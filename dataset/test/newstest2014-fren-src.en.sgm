<seg id="1">Jet makers feud over seat width with big orders at stake</seg>
<seg id="2">A row has flared up between leading plane makers over the width of tourist-class seats on long-distance flights, setting the tone for a bitter confrontation at this month's Dubai Airshow.</seg>
<seg id="3">The dispute focuses on the width of seats provided on long-haul flights for economy passengers - not always the ones most courted by airlines, but whose allocated space holds the key to efficiency claims for the latest jets offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.</seg>
<seg id="4">Airbus this week called for an industry standard that would provide for a seat at least 18 inches (46 cm) wide in economy cabins, but its U.S. arch-rival Boeing says it should be for airlines to decide.</seg>
<seg id="5">The dispute comes as plane makers vie to sell ever-larger versions of their twin-engined long-distance aircraft, with potentially record orders expected at the November 17-21 event.</seg>
<seg id="6">How the back of the plane is laid out - particularly whether seating is 9 or 10 abreast - is central to the economic performance claims being made for new "mini-jumbo" jet designs.</seg>
<seg id="7">Boeing says its revamped "777X" will hold 406 people based on economy seats more than 17 inches wide and set out 10 in each row.</seg>
<seg id="8">Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in 18-inch-wide economy seat laid out 9 abreast.</seg>
<seg id="9">Plane giants often trade blows on technical matters through advertising in the trade press.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now, Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to dominate with more than 100 orders.</seg>
<seg id="11">It recently previewed what may be the start of a new ad war by showing financiers a slide illustrating three people squashed together at a restaurant, titled "Would You Accept This?"</seg>
<seg id="12">"Boeing is proposing long-distance flying in seats narrower than regional turbo-props," said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.</seg>
<seg id="13">As diets change, people get bigger but plane seating has not radically changed.</seg>
<seg id="14">Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average American 40- to 49-year-old male increased by 10 per cent, according to U.S. Health Department Data.</seg>
<seg id="15">The waist of the average 21st-century American male is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.</seg>
<seg id="16">Airbus says its rival is sticking to a seat concept from the 1950s, when the average girth of the newly christened "jet set" was narrower.</seg>
<seg id="17">Airbus says it has commissioned research suggesting an extra inch in seat width improves sleep quality by 53 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="18">Boeing disputes Airbus's figures on seat measurements and says it is not up to manufacturers to step into decisions on how airlines balance fares and facilities.</seg>
<seg id="19">It also says research shows cabin experience depends on more than the width of a seat.</seg>
<seg id="20">"It really comes down to providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do the things that they believe they need to do to be successful," said Boeing cabins expert Kent Craver.</seg>
<seg id="21">They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.</seg>
<seg id="22">They know their business better than anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="23">For flyers it is about more elbow room, but for suppliers it is increasingly an issue that could affect earnings.</seg>
<seg id="24">Behind the dispute is a race for plane orders with at least $700-billion of estimated business at list prices in coming decades, enough to tip the scales of U.S. and European exports.</seg>
<seg id="25">As Reuters first reported in July, seat layout is exactly what drives the battle between the latest jets.</seg>
<seg id="26">Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 per cent better efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engined long-haul designs than the market leader in that segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.</seg>
<seg id="27">Boeing's performance claims depend in part on comparing the 10-abreast 777X with an original 9-abreast 777 design.</seg>
<seg id="28">The gain in unit costs is blunted compared with 10-abreast now in use.</seg>
<seg id="29">"The reason Boeing are doing this is to cram more seats in to make their plane more competitive with our products," said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at Europe's Airbus.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other hand, analysts say full 10-seat-per-row cabins for existing 777s suggest many passengers are voting for the denser layout, which may go hand in hand with cheaper fares.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Eighteen inches in seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from a business point of the Airbus proposal is driven by the threat of the 777," said cabin interiors expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.</seg>
<seg id="32">Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but offer a catalogue of suppliers for airlines to choose from.</seg>
<seg id="33">Globe-trotting jet sellers even carry tape measures to check on competing layouts.</seg>
<seg id="34">While boasting comfort, all builders also offer jets with high-density layouts for low-cost airlines and regional travel.</seg>
<seg id="35">Airbus offers a 10-abreast A350 but says it has not yet sold it.</seg>
<seg id="36">Until recently, Airbus was stressing the need for more cabin customization by offering wider aisle seats on some of its jets.</seg>
<seg id="37">Without the support of the only other maker of large modern jets, experts say its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to fly, but could distract from a wave of 777X sales.</seg>

<seg id="1">Daylight Saving Time 2013: Gain an Hour on Sunday</seg>
<seg id="2">Despite it happening twice a year, and despite a catchy saying to help you remember (Spring forward!</seg>
<seg id="3">Fall back!), the question on every reader's mind today is the same: are the clocks changing this weekend?</seg>
<seg id="4">The answer is yes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Daylight Savings Time ends this weekend, which means that most residents of the U.S. go back to Standard Time at 2 a.m. on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="6">To do that, we set the clocks back one hour.</seg>
<seg id="7">Here's a primer:</seg>
<seg id="8">Go to bed Saturday night, 11 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="9">Wake up Sunday morning, 9 a.m.</seg>
<seg id="10">Set the clock back one hour to 8 a.m. and keep snoozing.</seg>
<seg id="11">You're all set.</seg>
<seg id="12">The guidance outlined above does not apply to you if you live in Hawaii (where all the time is island time!) or most parts of Arizona.</seg>
<seg id="13">Enjoy your extra hour this weekend!</seg>

<seg id="1">China data buoys commodities - FT.com</seg>
<seg id="2">Friday 09:30 GMT.</seg>
<seg id="3">Better news on the Chinese economy is bolstering industrial commodities on hopes for improving demand.</seg>
<seg id="4">But better news on the US economy leaves stocks struggling to extend their rally as concerns that the era of Federal Reserve largesse may soon end provides an excuse for the re-evaluation of bullish bets.</seg>
<seg id="5">Global Market Overview</seg>
<seg id="6">That said, the end of the year is often a good period for stocks and an uptick in S&P 500 futures suggests traders at the start of the month are reluctant to miss out on any underlying seasonal optimism.</seg>
<seg id="7">The euro is again weaker - slipping 50 pips to $1.3532 - as the dollar firms and after the yen (JPY) was initially the main beneficiary of trader uncertainty in Asia.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gold, which fell $21 on Thursday as US interest rates rose, is down another $3 to $1,320 an ounce as benchmark Treasury yields nudge higher again.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The spectre of Fed tapering has spread gloom across global FX markets so far today, with risk-sensitive currencies struggling while the old fashioned safe havens like JPY prosper," said analysts at CitiFX in a note to clients.</seg>
<seg id="10">The FTSE All-World equity index, which earlier this week hit a near six-year high of 264.2, is easing 0.3 per cent to 260.9 for the session, weighed down by the Asia-Pacific region's 0.5 per cent dip and Europe's Stoxx 600 losing 0.2 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="11">US index futures suggest the S&P 500 will advance 2 points to 1,758.5, leaving it 17 points below the intraday record touched on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="12">The world's two biggest economies are, understandably, the focus of attention on the first day of the month.</seg>
<seg id="13">China's official purchasing manager's index edged forward from 51.1 in September to 51.4 last month.</seg>
<seg id="14">A private survey of the sector from HSBC confirmed the modestly upward trend, clocking in at a seven-month high of 50.9.</seg>
<seg id="15">In both surveys, a reading above 50 indicates expansion.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Shanghai Composite equity index rose 0.4 per cent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng was up 0.2 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, some economists remained concerned that the pace of growth could falter as the government reduces spending.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The strong rebound over July-August, which benefited from a shift in government policy focus to "stabilising growth" and industrial restocking, will not be sustained especially in view of a soft external recovery," wrote economists at Barclays.</seg>
<seg id="19">Nevertheless, the China PMI report is helping resources shrug off a firmer dollar, with copper up 0.6 per cent to $3.32 a pound and Brent crude gaining 30 cents to $109.14 a barrel.</seg>
<seg id="20">The dollar index is up 0.3 per cent to 80.46.</seg>
<seg id="21">It fell to an eight-month low of 79.0 a week ago as investors priced in expectations that the US central bank would not start tapering its $85bn-a-month quantitative easing programme until possibly March 2014.</seg>
<seg id="22">This view had bolstered global risk appetite, contributed to Wall Street advancing into virgin territory and forced Treasury yields lower.</seg>
<seg id="23">But the last few sessions have witnessed a reassessment of QE duration after the Fed delivered a supposedly less dovish than expected economic commentary and a closely watched survey of Midwest business activity came in notably stronger than forecast.</seg>
<seg id="24">Along with the buck's revival, and the mild dip in stocks, US borrowing costs have reversed course.</seg>
<seg id="25">The 10-year Treasury yield, which fell to 2.47 per cent on Tuesday, is up a further 2 basis points on Friday to 2.57 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="26">All eyes will now be on the nationwide ISM manufacturing report due for release on Friday at 1400 GMT - unexpected strength of which may reinforce the market's bearish "taper trade."</seg>
<seg id="27">Before that investors will get to absorb a raft of national manufacturing surveys.</seg>
<seg id="28">India's factories trimmed production in October for the third consecutive month but this couldn't stop Mumbai's Sensex index hitting a record high.</seg>
<seg id="29">Weakness in the rupee, which was soft along with many other emerging market currencies on those Fed tapering concerns, caused equity gains to be pared, leaving the Sensex up just 0.1 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Toyko, the dollar's early move below 98 yen delivered the standard reaction from the exporter-sensitive Nikkei 225, which dropped 0.9 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="31">After the market closed the yen started shedding some of its gains - its is now just 15 pips stronger at Y98.20 - and this may provide a lift for the Nikkei on Monday according to index futures.</seg>

<seg id="2">Marco Lavoie became stranded after a bear attack.</seg>
<seg id="3">The family gave this photo to police to help in their search.</seg>
<seg id="4">Bear attacked Marco Lavoie's campsite, leaving him without tools for survival</seg>
<seg id="5">The bear ate his food and ruined his equipment</seg>
<seg id="6">Police found him near death three months after he began trip</seg>
<seg id="7">(CNN) -- If Marco Lavoie had not been rescued when he was, the Quebec man probably would have perished within 48 hours.</seg>
<seg id="8">He was hypothermic, dehydrated and near starvation in the unforgiving cold of northwestern Quebec when police rescued him Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="9">Lavoie's survival might be called miraculous, as he had been in the wilderness for more than three months.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 44-year-old is an experienced outdoorsman, but an encounter with a bear changed his luck, Quebec police said</seg>
<seg id="11">At some point during a planned two-month canoe trek in the Lake Matagami area, a bear attacked Lavoie's campsite, eating his food and ruining his equipment, police spokeswoman Christine Coulombe said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The bear did not injure Lavoie but left him without the tools or resources to survive.</seg>
<seg id="13">Police say they have yet to speak with Lavoie to get details.</seg>
<seg id="14">Minnesota hiker falls from cliff to his death near Yosemite waterfall</seg>
<seg id="15">"In these parts, there's a subculture of people who go on these long trips into the middle of nowhere, but sometimes we forgot how dangerous it can be," Gerald Lemoine, mayor of a small town near Matagami, told the Montreal Gazette.</seg>
<seg id="16">The rescued canoeist began his adventure July 16, Coulombe said.</seg>
<seg id="17">It wasn't until three months later, on October 21, that his family called authorities because too long had passed without Lavoie's return.</seg>
<seg id="18">Police conducted searches for eight days, weather permitting, with no luck.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rescuers in a helicopter finally spotted Lavoie on Wednesday, but they could not safely land at that spot, Coulombe said.</seg>
<seg id="20">So officers had to hike in to pick him up and carry him more than a mile to the chopper.</seg>
<seg id="21">Lavoie's condition was such that he was barely able to speak and at first couldn't even drink water, the Gazette reported.</seg>
<seg id="22">Had he spent another day or two in the elements, he would have starved to death, police spokesman Ronald McInnis said.</seg>
<seg id="23">The man had lost half of his body weight, he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">It was Lavoie's German shepherd who scared the bear away on the day of the attack, but the dog did not survive the ordeal, McInnis said.</seg>
<seg id="25">Up there, in the Canadian shield, there's little plant life to live off, so he would have been slowly, painfully dying when they found him.</seg>
<seg id="26">"It's an amazing feat that he was able to keep himself alive this long with almost no equipment," survival instructor Caleb Musgrave told the Gazette.</seg>
<seg id="27">When you start to go hungry, you get mood swings, your mind breaks, and you cramp up all over your body.</seg>
<seg id="28">Eventually, your body will start cannibalizing itself, eating away at the fat in your organs and then in your muscles.</seg>
<seg id="29">"It takes someone who won't give up in the face of that," he added.</seg>

<seg id="1">Boy who killed neo-Nazi dad to serve time in juvenile detention</seg>
<seg id="2">From Chuck Conder, CNN</seg>
<seg id="3">October 31, 2013 -- Updated 2344 GMT (0744 HKT)</seg>
<seg id="4">A boy, then 10, fatally shot his father in 2011 as he was sleeping on a couch</seg>
<seg id="5">The father was a leader in the National Socialist Movement, a neo-Nazi group</seg>
<seg id="6">The boy, now 13, could remain at the juvenile facility until he is 23</seg>
<seg id="7">(CNN) -- A California judge ruled Thursday that a boy who murdered his father, a neo-Nazi leader, will serve his sentence in a yet-to-be-named juvenile detention facility.</seg>
<seg id="8">The boy was 10 when he killed his father, Jeffrey Hall.</seg>
<seg id="9">He is now 13 and could remain at the facility until he is 23.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hall was asleep on a couch in his family's Riverside home when his son killed him on May 1, 2011, according to authorities.</seg>
<seg id="11">CNN is not naming the boy because he is a juvenile.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hall had been the Southwestern states regional director for the National Socialist Movement, according to an online tribute to him from the group's leader, Jeff Schoep.</seg>
<seg id="13">One of the nation's biggest, most well-known neo-Nazi organizations, the National Socialist Movement idolizes Adolf Hitler and touts virulent rhetoric against those who are Jewish, immigrants and not "pure-blood whites," according to the Southern Poverty Law Center civil rights group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Prosecutors contend the victim's neo-Nazi background is not linked to his death, saying the young killer's concerns about abuse and his family being split up were more significant factors.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It was our belief that this would have happened even if (Hall) was not part of the National Socialist Movement," said John Hall, a spokesman for the Riverside County district attorney's office.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was done more on a domestic level.</seg>
<seg id="17">The boy was detained in juvenile halls in Riverside County after the shooting.</seg>
<seg id="18">His lawyers initially sought an insanity defense but later dropped that approach and argued their client didn't fully grasp the ramifications of what he did, the spokesman said.</seg>
<seg id="19">The murder trial before county Judge Jean Leonard -- and not a jury -- got underway October 30, 2012, continuing off-and-on for about 10 days over four months, ending January.</seg>
<seg id="20">As there are no "guilty" or "not guilty" verdicts in her California juvenile court, Leonard instead found it "true" that the boy had committed second-degree murder and understood his actions were wrong.</seg>

<seg id="2">He said: "Tomorrow you will know."</seg>
<seg id="3">It is a decision I have to take every week with the 22 players.</seg>
<seg id="4">Hart's omission follows a series of errors over the past year, although both City - and England manager Roy Hodgson - had up this point stuck by the player, who has been seen as comfortably the leading English goalkeeper currently playing.</seg>
<seg id="5">Hodgson will be concerned that Hart is not excluded from City's starting team for an extended part of a season which will be followed by the World Cup Finals in Brazil.</seg>
<seg id="6">Pelligrini said at the press conference he intended to be "careful" not to damage Hart's confidence, adding: "I am very careful with all the players, not only Joe."</seg>

<seg id="3">Picture: John Fotiadis Source: DailyTelegraph</seg>
<seg id="4">HE ARRIVED in Australia as a humble Fijian porter who had never owned a pair of footy boots.</seg>
<seg id="5">Yet eight months on, and with a brand new pair of Asics on his feet, Etonia Nabuli is set to complete the greatest story of the rugby league season when he runs onto ANZ Stadium this Sunday for the NRL grand final day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Plucked from obscurity by Andrew Johns and Brad Fittler, whose bags the 23-year-old carried after they arrived at his Intercontinental Hotel during a goodwill mission last December, Nabuli will start on the wing for Penrith feeder club Windsor in the NSW Cup decider.</seg>
<seg id="7">The flyer has scored 28 tries in just 25 games this season - the most in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="8">He scored five tries in his first two games and has failed to score only once in his past 12 matches - scoring 10 tries in the past eight starts.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's an incredible story made even more remarkable when you consider, before this year, he had never even played rugby league.</seg>
<seg id="10">"No, always rugby union," he grins.</seg>
<seg id="11">But this isn't just my first league grand final, it's also my first grand final ever.</seg>
<seg id="12">Etonia Nabuli with Penrith and Roosters great Brad Fittler.</seg>
<seg id="13">When I rang home this week to tell mum, she couldn't believe it.</seg>
<seg id="14">Started crying on the phone.</seg>
<seg id="15">Where I'm from in Fiji, near Sigatoka, everyone plays rugby.</seg>
<seg id="16">So they couldn't believe I would try to play league.</seg>
<seg id="17">They told me 'you're a union player, you won't do any good'.</seg>
<seg id="18">So from that moment I decided I wanted to play in a Grand Final.</seg>

<seg id="20">Then they would know I was progressing in the game.</seg>
<seg id="21">Andrew Johns and Brad Fittler's Fiji mission to find new NRL talent, including Etonia Nabuli, who has been signed by Penrith.</seg>
<seg id="22">While his own family, who reside in Nadro, have no television set, 'Eto' says they still see the game thanks to a neighbouring cousin who receives Origins and Grand Finals via Sky.</seg>
<seg id="23">"So I'm just so excited," he told The Daily Telegraph on Tuesday, watching the Fijian schoolboy rugby side play Australia at Knox Grammar.</seg>
<seg id="24">Growing up in Fiji, I never used to own a pair of boots.</seg>
<seg id="25">Always trained barefoot.</seg>
<seg id="26">A lot of us even lifted weights that way because we didn't have shoes -- (laughs) which can be a bit dangerous when they're being dropped everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="27">Incredibly, Nabuli would still be lugging bags around the Intercontinental foyer had it not been for Fittler and Johns, who were taken by the athletic build of their porter who, said Johns, "you'd offer $1 million for if he were a racehorse."</seg>
<seg id="28">Etonia Nabuli training in Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="29">Inviting him to a training clinic later that day, the pair were so shocked by his results in testing they immediately made calls to a variety of NRL clubs, with Panthers supremo Phil Gould eventually agreeing to sign him sight unseen.</seg>
<seg id="30">And so unbelievable has the rise of Nabuli been since, Johns and Fittler re now developing a 'Footy For Fiji' program.</seg>
<seg id="31">They will fly to the island less than 24 hours after working the grand final for Channel Nine in the hope of finding a second athlete to follow in his footsteps.</seg>
<seg id="32">Not only will the legendary league pairing hold an open trial day in Sigatoka, they will also select, and coach, two teams for a match to be broadcast nationally in Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="33">From there, one player will be chosen and signed to an NRL contract, given the same chance Gould gifted 'Eto' on nothing but the advice from Fittler.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Yeah, Phil is a good bloke," Nabuli laughs.</seg>
<seg id="35">He just messages me to say Bula and see how I'm doing.</seg>
<seg id="36">I tell him everything is good and he says 'okay, okay, great, keep playing'.</seg>
<seg id="37">Etonia Nabuli, who was signed by Penrith, at the Fijian hotel where he worked as a porter.</seg>
<seg id="38">And that's what I do.</seg>
<seg id="39">This time next year, I want to be in the NRL.</seg>

<seg id="1">"World's Heaviest Athlete" Now Looking to Slim Down</seg>
<seg id="2">Caters News Agency</seg>
<seg id="3">Though he's nicknamed "Tiny," a 6-foot-7, 719-pound sumo wrestler is anything but.</seg>
<seg id="4">And now the "World's Heaviest Athlete" title holder is on a mission to slim down.</seg>
<seg id="5">Manny Yarbrough has used his weight to his advantage in his career in sumo, and as a child he had to hold back when playing with other kids.</seg>
<seg id="6">"When I was a child, I played every sport I could but I was always the "big kid" - it was just my luck in life," he said.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I'd do what everybody else did growing up, but from the age of about 6 I knew I was bigger than the others and probably always would be," he added.</seg>
<seg id="8">When we were playing with friends, I had to remember to hold back so I didn't hurt anyone.</seg>
<seg id="9">"It's partly down to genetics, as it isn't just weight," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">I have always been tall too.</seg>
<seg id="11">People never used to pay attention to the nutritional value of food, and I was growing pretty fast so needed to eat.</seg>
<seg id="12">My aunt would make big breakfasts because my cousins went out to work - but I wasn't accustomed to that.</seg>
<seg id="13">I just hung out and ate with them.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now, Yarbrough is looking to lose weight as he plans on retiring from the ring in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="15">He fears his weight could keep growing as when he calls it quits, which would lead to serious health problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm desperate to get back to my best college shape in time for the nationals next year.</seg>
<seg id="17">"It's the sportsman in me that never-give-up attitude," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">It's a challenge.</seg>
<seg id="19">I had to give it a shot because of that inner athlete in me pushing me to do it.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Once I retire," he added, "it's about a quality of life I want to have."</seg>

<seg id="1">Harsh truths about the decline of Britain</seg>
<seg id="2">The ONS analysis shows that we are now going the other way.</seg>
<seg id="3">The amount of our income accounted for by "essentials" - housing, water, sewerage, energy bills and fuel - has risen over a decade from 19.9 per cent to 27.3 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="4">Once food is taken into account, the numbers are more striking still.</seg>
<seg id="5">Cumulative inflation as measured by the Consumer Prices Index - the yardstick used by the Bank of England - has been roughly 30 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="6">Yet the Tullett Prebon Essentials Index - which takes in most of the necessities of modern living - has gone up by more than 60 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="7">Consumers" discretionary spending has been eroded even more severely than that fall in disposable income suggests.</seg>
<seg id="8">This inflation seems to be a very British disease.</seg>
<seg id="9">Stripping out the effect of tax rises, the eurozone as a whole is now in deflation, with even energy prices down 1.7 per cent year on year.</seg>
<seg id="10">A deflationary spiral is never something a highly indebted economy like ours would want to get into, but just a smidgen of falling prices would be more than welcome right now.</seg>
<seg id="11">Exhibit C: education.</seg>
<seg id="12">An international survey by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has found standards of literacy and numeracy among school-leavers in England and Northern Ireland to be among the lowest in the developed world.</seg>
<seg id="13">Shockingly, older people leaving the workforce were better educated than those joining it.</seg>
<seg id="14">This may be the first time in recorded history that such a phenomenon has occurred, with the young worse educated than their parents.</seg>
<seg id="15">The upshot, as the OECD observes, is that the "talent pool of highly skilled adults is likely to shrink relative to other countries."</seg>
<seg id="16">The implications for living standards are close to disastrous.</seg>
<seg id="17">The average worker in the highest literacy band will earn 94 per cent more than someone in the lowest.</seg>
<seg id="18">With rare exceptions - usually driven, entrepreneurial types - you cannot dream of entering the "global race," let alone winning it, with such poor levels of educational achievement.</seg>
<seg id="19">In identifying the causes, we can safely discount the amount of public money thrown at education, which as a percentage of GDP is roughly in the middle of the OECD pack, and actually higher than some countries that score better.</seg>
<seg id="20">It would also be too easy to blame poor standards of teaching and/or relatively high levels of low-skilled immigration, though these things obviously play a part.</seg>
<seg id="21">A more fundamental cause is widening levels of social inequality, with their attendant - and growing - deficit in aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="22">Studies from the US show that achievement gaps start to widen as early as 18 months into a child's life.</seg>
<seg id="23">By three, children of professional parents will have heard 30 million more words than those from low-income homes.</seg>
<seg id="24">Exhibit D: health.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to a report this week from the World Health Organisation, Britain faces a public health "time bomb."</seg>
<seg id="26">Obesity, female life expectancy and child mortality rates are among the worst in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="27">Again, the amount spent on public health care - which is roughly average for OECD countries - is not the problem.</seg>
<seg id="28">Much more fundamental is that a poor start to life will significantly impair later health outcomes.</seg>
<seg id="29">Some of the right things are being done to address these failings - in education and welfare in particular - but they are too slow, and insufficiently bold, to produce a meaningful turnaround.</seg>
<seg id="30">The result is that Britain is living on borrowed time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Yet much of the political debate remains mired in complete or positively harmful irrelevancies - price controls, windfall profit taxes, government support for a feel-good bounce in the housing market, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="32">Sad to say, we still have our heads buried in the sand over the supply-side revolution the UK so desperately needs.</seg>

<seg id="1">As Cuts to Food Stamps Take Effect, More Trims to Benefits Are Expected</seg>
<seg id="2">Starting Friday, millions of Americans receiving food stamps will be required to get by with less government assistance every month, a move that not only will cost them money they use to feed their families but is expected to slightly dampen economic growth as well.</seg>
<seg id="3">Luke Sharrett for The New York Times</seg>
<seg id="4">Kathy Baucom of Newbern, Tenn., who receives food stamps, in August picked up goods from a food bank.</seg>
<seg id="5">Congress plans to further shrink the program, which benefits 48 million Americans.</seg>
<seg id="6">Cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, popularly referred to as food stamps, reflect the lapse of a temporary increase created by the administration's stimulus program in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are slated to go into effect separately from continuing negotiations over renewal of the federal farm support program, which looks likely to further cut funds for food stamps, which this fiscal year are expected to come to about $76.4 billion.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Republican-controlled House version of the farm bill proposes cutting $39 billion from the program over the next decade; the Democratic-controlled Senate would cut $4 billion over the same period.</seg>
<seg id="9">The food stamp cuts scheduled to go into effect on Nov.</seg>
<seg id="10">1 will reduce spending by $5 billion in the 2014 fiscal year, and another $6 billion over the 2015 and 2016 fiscal years.</seg>
<seg id="11">They are expected to shave 0.2 percentage point from annualized consumption growth in the fourth quarter of 2013 and trim an estimated 0.1 percentage point off the annual growth rate of the nation's gross domestic product, according to estimates by Michael Feroli, the chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase.</seg>
<seg id="12">Those drags may seem small, but right now projections for gains in fourth-quarter gross domestic product hover around an annual rate of just 2 percent.</seg>
<seg id="13">"This could potentially affect consumption of food as well as nonfood items, as individuals may maintain the same food intake but reduce spending on other items," Mr. Feroli said.</seg>
<seg id="14">The amount that beneficiaries will lose depends on the size of the family.</seg>
<seg id="15">For a family of four receiving the maximum amount, monthly benefits will fall to $632 from $668, or a decline of $36, according to the Agriculture Department.</seg>
<seg id="16">The maximum benefits for a single adult would fall to $189 from $200, or by $11.</seg>
<seg id="17">Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits were increased in 2009 as part of a suite of measures intended to support struggling workers and stimulate the economy in the wake of the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="18">The maximum monthly amount received per food stamp beneficiary rose by 13.6 percent at the time.</seg>
<seg id="19">Food stamp caseloads have swollen in the last few years: In fiscal year 2007, before the recession began, there were about 26 million people receiving food stamps.</seg>
<seg id="20">As of this past July, the most recent month of data available, there were nearly 48 million, representing about a seventh of the American population.</seg>
<seg id="21">The increase has been attributed to more people losing their jobs and needing food assistance; government efforts to increase usage by families that did not know they were eligible; and to a lesser extent, policy changes in some states that relaxed eligibility requirements, according to Stacy Dean, vice president for food assistance policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research organization.</seg>
<seg id="22">The 2009 increase in maximum monthly food stamp benefits was designed to be temporary.</seg>
<seg id="23">But as with other stimulus measures or social safety programs that received temporary increases during or after the recession - like the payroll tax holiday, or extended unemployment benefits - advocates have been fighting to push expiration off longer.</seg>
<seg id="24">These arguments are made on the grounds of both compassion and the fragility of the recovery.</seg>
<seg id="25">Measures that grant more spending power to lower-income people generally have strong effects throughout the economy because the money is spent immediately and then re-spent.</seg>
<seg id="26">Moody's Analytics has estimated that every additional dollar spent on food stamps generates about $1.74 in economic activity.</seg>
<seg id="27">The payroll tax holiday was renewed once, before it was finally allowed to lapse in January.</seg>
<seg id="28">Similarly, unemployment benefits to jobless workers for longer than the normal maximum of 26 weeks have been extended repeatedly, although the maximum duration of benefits has fallen from a peak of 99 weeks to 73 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Emergency Unemployment Compensation program, financed by the federal government for states that meet certain unemployment and state benefit thresholds, is scheduled to end Jan.</seg>
<seg id="30">The recent fiscal showdown in Washington make further extensions less likely.</seg>
<seg id="31">And the end of these emergency unemployment benefits could create a further drag on the economy.</seg>
<seg id="32">The so-called food stamp cliff "may be more of a sidewalk curb," Mr. Feroli wrote in an email.</seg>
<seg id="33">The bigger cliff, which I'm surprised people aren't talking about, is emergency unemployment benefits Jan.</seg>
<seg id="34">That, he estimated, could shave 0.4 percentage point off growth in the first quarter next year.</seg>

<seg id="2">31, 2013 - Reports identify new sampling and testing methods that improve accuracy in the detection of quagga and zebra mussels and outline procedures used to test for them.</seg>
<seg id="3">The earliest possible detection of quagga and zebra mussels has long been a goal of biologists seeking to discover their presence in water bodies.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Bureau of Reclamation's Detection Laboratory has released two reports identifying a new sampling method to improve the accuracy of quagga and zebra mussel detection while still at the microscopic larval stage.</seg>
<seg id="5">The reports also outline the processes and procedures used to identify invasive mussels through DNA testing.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Improving the accuracy of testing provides Reclamation and its partners better information about the presence of quagga and zebra mussels in water bodies where our facilities are located," laboratory manager Denise Hosler said.</seg>
<seg id="7">These sampling procedures allow for the improved detection when the mussels are in their larval stage.</seg>
<seg id="8">For early detection, Reclamation searches samples from reservoirs, lakes, canals and other water bodies for the microscopic larval form of quagga and zebra mussels.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because they are so small, multiple testing methods are used, including cross-polarized light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and PCR testing of the DNA of larvae in the water sample.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Early detection of mussel larvae does not mean that the water body will necessarily become infested," Reclamation's Director of Research and Development Curt Brown said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Early detection provides a warning for managers that a water body is being exposed to mussels through some pathway, so they can consider additional means to prevent further introduction.</seg>
<seg id="12">Reclamation's Detection Laboratory is located in the Technical Service Center in Denver.</seg>
<seg id="13">It specializes in invasive mussels and also identifies species through taxonomic and genetic testing.</seg>
<seg id="14">It was awarded the Colorado Governor's Award for High Impact Research in 2012 for its work advancing the early detection of invasive quagga and zebra mussels.</seg>

<seg id="2">Mothers-to-be who snore are more likely to give birth to smaller babies, a study has found.</seg>
<seg id="3">Snoring during pregnancy was also linked to higher rates of Caesarean delivery.</seg>
<seg id="4">Experts said snoring may be a sign of breathing problems that could deprive an unborn baby of oxygen.</seg>
<seg id="5">Previous research has already shown that women who start to snore during pregnancy are at risk from high blood pressure and the potentially dangerous pregnancy condition pre-eclampsia.</seg>
<seg id="6">More than a third of the 1,673 pregnant women recruited for the new US study reported habitual snoring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Scientists found that women who snored in their sleep three or more nights per week had a higher risk of poor delivery outcomes, including smaller babies and Caesarean births.</seg>
<seg id="8">Chronic snorers, who snored both before and during pregnancy, were two thirds more likely to have a baby whose weight was in the bottom 10 per cent.</seg>

<seg id="6">Nine month-old cocker spaniel Ruby had run off after being involved in a road crash on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Her owners Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, were at Flappit Quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to be reunited with Ruby and have thanked West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.</seg>
<seg id="8">They had searched frantically for their missing dog and posted appeals on social networking sites after she had ran into the quarry following the minor accident.</seg>

<seg id="1">Report: Obama campaign considered dumping Biden for Hillary Clinton</seg>
<seg id="2">President Barack Obama's closest advisers secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 ticket, according to the New York Times.</seg>
<seg id="3">The revelation is the most notable bombshell from Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's heavily anticipated 2012 campaign tome, "Double Down: Game Change 2012."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday evening that the President's top aides conducted "extensive group-sessions and polling in late 2011" to gauge whether the dumping Biden could help bolster Obama's waning re-election hopes.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the Times' national political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book provides a thorough account of the effort by senior officials inside the campaign and the White House, namely former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure what effect swapping former Secretary of State Clinton for the Vice President would have in the polls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The potential switch was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="7">Only half a dozen of the President's closest advisers -- including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe -- knew the change was under consideration.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Double Down" claims Daley spearheaded the effort to replace Biden, despite their "close personal rapport," before ultimately deciding against the move when their data showed adding Clinton to the ticket wouldn't "materially improve Obama's odds."</seg>
<seg id="9">In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration did in fact consider replacing Biden with Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I was vocal about looking into a whole bunch of things, and this was one of them," Daley told the paper.</seg>
<seg id="11">You have to remember, at that point the President was in awful shape, so we were like, "Holy Christ, what do we do?"</seg>
<seg id="12">While Daley characterized the research as "due diligence," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign made a significant investment in finding out whether the move would pay dividends at the polls.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Campaigns don't spend the kind of money on polling and focus groups unless they're seriously considering something," Martin said on AC360.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's unclear, however, whether Obama knew his team was exploring the swap.</seg>
<seg id="15">Martin told CNN that he asked Daley whether his then-boss knew about the potential shuffle.</seg>
<seg id="16">While Daley said he doesn't think the President "was aware" of the potential change, the former chief of staff admitted that it's "possible" Obama knew.</seg>
<seg id="17">Martin added that "Double Down" does not definitively answer whether the political probing reached Obama's desk.</seg>
<seg id="18">Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thought Obama did not know about the research into dumping Biden from the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Possibly," Martin replied.</seg>

<seg id="1">Australia mulls lifting of electronics restrictions on flights</seg>
<seg id="2">Fliers 'on board' with new gadget rules</seg>
<seg id="3">US airline passengers will now be allowed to use electronic devices during takeoffs and landings on planes that meet certain criteria, US aviation authorities say.</seg>
<seg id="4">PT1M19Shttp://www.smh.com.au/action/externalEmbeddedPlayer?id=d-2wn08620349November 1, 2013 - 10:36AM</seg>
<seg id="5">A move to allow US airline passengers to use mobile electronic devices in flight is being watched closely by Australian airlines and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="6">The US Federal Aviation Administration will put an end to stricter regulations that have barred the use of electronics during taxi, takeoff and landing for the past 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">The changes are expected to take effect on most US-based carriers by the end of this year.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It is safe to read downloaded materials like e-books and calendars, and also to play games": Michael Huerta, FAA.</seg>
<seg id="9">Photo: Getty Images/AFP</seg>
<seg id="10">"Airlines can safely expand passenger use of portable electronic devices during all phases of flight," FAA administrator Michael Huerta said at Reagan National Airport near Washington, DC.</seg>
<seg id="11">A Qantas spokesman said the airline was assessing the FAA ruling but it had no current plans for change.</seg>
<seg id="12">The FAA ruling applies to American airlines.</seg>
<seg id="13">"However, we are always interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers and we will certainly be taking a close look at the FAA's decision and the reasons behind it," he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">A spokesman for Australia's Civil Aviation Safety Authority said that the agency was examining the FAA decision, but in the meantime the current restrictions remained in place.</seg>
<seg id="15">"CASA currently has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft," the spokesman said.</seg>
<seg id="16">The issue is covered by regulations which require aircraft operators to ensure safety is maintained at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the US, the relaxed safety guidelines came from a committee convened last year to study the matter, and included input from pilots, passengers, flight attendants, aviation manufacturers and experts from the mobile technology industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The committee determined that most commercial aeroplanes can tolerate radio interference from portable electronic devices," Huerta said.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is safe to read downloaded materials like e-books and calendars, and also to play games.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, in rare cases passengers may be asked to turn off their devices when there is low visibility due to poor weather, he said.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Some landing systems may not be proven to tolerate the interference," Huerta said, describing this as "a very small percentage - we are saying one per cent of flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"If the captain asks you to shut off the device, it is for a good reason," he added.</seg>
<seg id="23">Mobile phones still cannot be used for voice calls while in flight, due to rules from another agency, the US Federal Communications Commission.</seg>
<seg id="24">Passengers will be advised to use their mobile devices in aeroplane mode, which shuts off the cellular band technology.</seg>
<seg id="25">But flight attendants will not be required to check individual devices, so the rule will likely go unenforced.</seg>
<seg id="26">"There is no safety problem if it isn't [in aeroplane mode]," Huerta added.</seg>
<seg id="27">But you are going to arrive at your destination with a dead battery, and I don't think anyone wants that.</seg>
<seg id="28">He also addressed concerns that passengers may become more distracted by their devices, making them more likely to ignore the flight attendants as they describe emergency procedures prior to takeoff.</seg>
<seg id="29">The changes affect airline carriers that are under the regulatory authority of the FAA, meaning US-based carriers, and will apply to the full scope of their international and domestic operations, Huerta said.</seg>
<seg id="30">The committee called on the FAA to work with international regulatory authorities so that expanded use of personal devices is "universally accepted."</seg>
<seg id="31">European aviation authorities also said they are planning to allow the usage of portable electronic devices during flights.</seg>
<seg id="32">"It is clear that it is necessary to develop the rules in force and the conditions of their application," a spokesman for the European Aviation Safety Agency said.</seg>
<seg id="33">The new FAA guidelines are being distributed to airlines now.</seg>
<seg id="34">Delta Air Lines said it was already making changes and would be ready to allow passengers to use mobile devices below 10,000 feet as early as November 1.</seg>
<seg id="35">The very first FAA restrictions on personal electronics in flight date back to 1966, when studies showed portable FM radio receivers caused interference with some plane navigation systems.</seg>
<seg id="36">But some concern was expressed by Senator John (Jay) Rockefeller, chair of the committee on commerce, science and transportation.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Having access to email or a movie is not worth compromising the safety of any flight," he said, calling for "exhaustive oversight" of the changes by the FAA.</seg>
<seg id="38">The new rules say bulkier electronic items must be still be stowed, either in the overhead bin or under the seat, during takeoff and landing.</seg>
<seg id="39">Smaller devices can be held or put in the seat back pocket during takeoff and landing.</seg>
<seg id="40">Browsing the internet will continue to be possible on airlines that provide Wi-Fi in flight, and Bluetooth technology for wireless keyboards will also be allowed.</seg>
<seg id="41">"I think it'll be great," said Mike Sullivan, 62, a musician and therapist who described himself as a frequent traveller.</seg>
<seg id="42">It seems like there is always someone who doesn't want to turn off their device.</seg>
<seg id="43">It creates a little bit of tension.</seg>

<seg id="1">The shutdown in the USA has slowed down the automotive market.</seg>
<seg id="2">According to figures published on Friday by manufacturers, five of the top six of which have recorded results below expectations, the 16-day shutdown of most federal administration services suppressed growth in car sales in the USA in October.</seg>
<seg id="3">The three major manufacturers in Detroit realised double-digit growth as compared to October 2012, but only General Motors performed better than expected.</seg>
<seg id="4">Analysts had forecast average sales of 15.4 million units (annualised rate, adjusted with seasonal variations), but the market settled at 15.3 million, according to estimates by Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a note to the bank's clients, he states that this slight slow-down can principally be explained by "the government shutdown and its impact on consumers' feelings in the first half of the month."</seg>
<seg id="6">Nevertheless, GM has reported an increase of about 16% in sales last month with 226,402 vehicles, as compared to 211,563 expected by consensus.</seg>
<seg id="7">The four brands of the group saw an improvement in their commercial performance over October 2012.</seg>
<seg id="8">Ford, which is still reaping benefits from the success of its pick-up trucks amongst other things, saw sales increase by 14% over a year to 191,985 vehicles, against an expectation of 194,301.</seg>
<seg id="9">On its part, Chrysler, which is controlled by Fiat, announced an 11% increase in sales with 140,083 vehicles, against an expected 143,536.</seg>
<seg id="10">Toyota and Nissan also reported sales below expectations, despite increases of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively over a year.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the New York Stock Exchange, GM shares gained 1.4% at 16:35 GMT, while Ford lost 1.1%.</seg>

<seg id="1">Egypt court rules against military</seg>
<seg id="2">AN Egyptian court has suspended a government decision allowing military police and intelligence to arrest civilians, a setback for the country's military rulers after the decree drew an outcry from opponents who accused them of trying to impose martial law.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Justice Ministry issued a decree on June 13 that allowed military police and intelligence agents to arrest civilians for even minor offences such as traffic violations.</seg>
<seg id="4">Rights activists feared the new powers essentially reproduced the country's hated emergency law, which had expired just two weeks earlier after more than 30 years in force.</seg>
<seg id="5">The emergency law granted broad powers of arrest and detention to police that were abused over the years and fed the popular anger that led to last year's uprising.</seg>
<seg id="6">Critics said the new powers of detention could extend the rule of the generals, even if they transfer power to the elected president by the end of this month as promised.</seg>
<seg id="7">"This (court ruling) is the best possible way to have such a repressive law struck down," said Heba Morayef, a researcher with Human Rights Watch in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is a pretty significant decision against a decree that would have permanently given the military this right of law enforcement and encroachment on civilian life.</seg>
<seg id="9">Military officials said at the time that the new powers were only meant to fill a security vacuum resulting from the uprising when the police force collapsed and disappeared from the streets during the first days of mass protests.</seg>
<seg id="10">The government, which was appointed by the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), can appeal the court decision.</seg>
<seg id="11">The military has pledged to turn power over to a civilian government once a new president is named.</seg>
<seg id="12">On Sunday, Islamist Mohammed Morsi of the fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood was declared Egypt's first freely elected president in modern history.</seg>
<seg id="13">However Mr Morsi is facing a power struggle with the military rulers after they stripped the presidency of its major powers one week before the winner of the election was announced.</seg>
<seg id="14">The ruling military council has used court decrees and constitutional declarations to stop Islamists from controlling all the executive and legislative branches.</seg>
<seg id="15">The same court postponed a key decision on overturning the ruling military council's order to disband the Islamist-dominated parliament.</seg>

<seg id="3">Kaka will play tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id="4">"He's got his strength back, and is improving physically," Allegri told a news conference.</seg>

<seg id="1">California man agrees to plead guilty to extortion of Miss Teen USA</seg>
<seg id="2">By Alex Dobuzinskis</seg>
<seg id="3">LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A 19-year-old California man has agreed to plead guilty to charges he hacked into the webcams of Miss Teen USA and other young women to take nude pictures in an extortion scheme, court papers revealed on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">Jared Abrahams agreed to plead guilty to charges of unauthorized access of protected computers and extortion linked to the case, the documents said.</seg>
<seg id="5">Miss Teen USA Cassidy Wolf, also 19, came forward to media organizations in September identifying herself as one of the targets of the hacking, which ensnared at least 12 young women between 2012 and June 2013.</seg>
<seg id="6">Wolf told NBC's "Today" program she had gone to high school with Abrahams in the Southern California city of Temecula.</seg>
<seg id="7">The women, who were only identified by initials, were in their late teens or early 20s and one lived in Ireland and another was in Canada, a statement of fact in the plea agreement said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Abrahams, who lived in Riverside County at the time, would gain access to the Facebook and other social media accounts of the women and remotely take pictures of them by accessing their webcams, the plea agreement said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Many of the photos he took were of them nude, the document said.</seg>
<seg id="10">He would then threaten to post the pictures on the women's social media pages unless they sent him more naked photos or videos or spoke to him by video chat on Skype and did what he demanded for five minutes, the court papers said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Abrahams signed the plea agreement with federal prosecutors on October 22 and, amid media reports of the deal, a representative for the U.S. Attorney's Office on Thursday sent out an electronic copy of the document.</seg>
<seg id="12">Abrahams faces a maximum sentence of 11 years in prison and a fine of $1 million, but in exchange for a guilty plea the U.S. Attorney's Office agreed to ask a judge to sentence him to between 27 and 33 months behind bars.</seg>
<seg id="13">He is expected to formally enter his plea at a court hearing within the first two weeks of November.</seg>
<seg id="14">Alan Eisner, an attorney for Abrahams, did not immediately return a call seeking comment.</seg>
<seg id="15">In September, Eisner said his client and his family want to "accept the responsibility" and "apologize to the victims, not only the girls, but their families."</seg>
<seg id="16">Abrahams until recently attended college and is on the autism spectrum, which "affects his ability to engage in reciprocal communications," Eisner said at the time.</seg>

<seg id="1">Review: 1984, Richmond Theatre, London</seg>
<seg id="2">There is no doubting that Headlong's production of Orwell's dystopian novel is one of some power and tremendous ingenuity.</seg>
<seg id="3">I left the theatre feeling genuinely unsettled - but not moved.</seg>
<seg id="4">The truth was I didn't especially care what happened to Winston, or Julia, or Parsons, or Syme or any individual of Airstrip One.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is perhaps a fault of Orwell's text, I have never found the characters of 1984 especially believable or sympathetic.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has always struck me as a novel in which ideas trump humanity.</seg>
<seg id="7">Hara Yannis, as Julia, was probably the most successful at fleshing out Orwell's original - her Julia has a depth of thought which Orwell's lacks.</seg>
<seg id="8">The rest of the cast are an excellent as an ensemble and, at the risk of sounding like Big Brother, the individual is not important in this production.</seg>
<seg id="9">What matters is the atmosphere generated by the cast, the designers and the technicians collectively.</seg>
<seg id="10">And that atmosphere is powerfully uncomfortable.</seg>
<seg id="11">The most distinctive feature of Robert Icke's and Duncan Macmillan's adaptation is the attempt to dramatise Orwell's appendix, "The Principles of Newspeak" using a book group which is reading Winston's diary sometime in the 22nd century.</seg>
<seg id="12">While I can see the arguments for this framing device - it reinforces the play's message that 1984 is not a story of its time, but of all times and sets up the questions it wants the audience to leave pondering - I think it is a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="13">It makes heavy-handed what otherwise would have been subtle and comes across as, at best, overly earnest and, at worst, patronising.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is a failure not only to trust the intelligence of the audience but also the quality of the material.</seg>
<seg id="15">Few stories could be better suited to Headlong, a company known for its digital innovativeness.</seg>
<seg id="16">Diaries are projected overhead and whole scenes are performed off-stage, watched by the audience through hidden telescreens rendering the audience voyeurs and chillingly complicit in Big Brother's surveillance.</seg>
<seg id="17">At one point the sinister O'Brien denies the possibility of revolution among the proles.</seg>
<seg id="18">"They wouldn't," he says, "Look up from their telescreens long enough to notice what is happening."</seg>
<seg id="19">How far, we end up asking ourselves, are we in the thrall of Big Brother?</seg>
<seg id="20">And even more radically, how far is Big Brother already part of us?</seg>

<seg id="1">NSA revelations boost corporate paranoia about state surveillance</seg>
<seg id="2">On a mild day in late August a German police helicopter buzzed low over the US consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="3">On the instruction of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany's domestic intelligence agency, its mission was to photograph the rooftop of the US outpost, which is located less than 5km from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank.</seg>
<seg id="4">German media say the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and the action prompted an exchange between the US and the German foreign ministry in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="5">James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, insisted again in September that the US does not use foreign intelligence capabilities "to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their bottom line."</seg>
<seg id="6">But ever since Edward Snowden, the contractor turned whistleblower, began releasing his treasure trove of US surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether to take the director at his word.</seg>
<seg id="7">Reports that the US National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to data held by US cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have ratcheted corporate paranoia about state surveillance to new highs.</seg>
<seg id="8">The final straw came when it was revealed that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been bugged, possibly for about a decade.</seg>
<seg id="9">If Europe's most powerful person can be targeted, then surely business leaders are also potential targets.</seg>
<seg id="10">Snowden has made transparent the intensive collaboration between US intelligence services and companies.</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it's conceivable that these data are used for mutual benefit.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Germany must wake up," says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium sized German IT companies.</seg>
<seg id="13">German companies believe the US now poses almost as big a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by EY, the consultancy.</seg>
<seg id="14">In all the documentation leaked by Mr Snowden, there has, however, been no evidence to date that the US has passed on foreign companies' trade secrets to its own companies.</seg>
<seg id="15">Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and internet capabilities and should strive to reduce its dependence on the US.</seg>
<seg id="16">Business leaders are sceptical about this.</seg>
<seg id="17">Someone in the German parliament says we should build a German Google.</seg>
<seg id="18">I can only shut my eyes and slowly open them again...</seg>
<seg id="19">"That's not the way," Hasso Plattner, chairman of German business software company SAP, says.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one wanted a strong European IT industry, then one shouldn't have let it die out 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="21">Everything is subsidised in Germany, from coal, to cars and farmers.</seg>
<seg id="22">Everything but the IT industry.</seg>
<seg id="23">Still, the reach and technical sophistication of US spy agencies exposed by the Snowden revelations have come as a shock to some companies who previously thought the biggest surveillance risk was posed by China.</seg>
<seg id="24">A big shift is occurring in cloud computing where European executives have become more aware that data stored in the US is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade body, some 10 per cent of non-US members cancelled plans to use a US-based cloud provider after revelations about the US Prism data mining programme.</seg>
<seg id="26">Jim Snabe, co-chief executive at SAP, says: "We see a new question from customers that didn't come up a year ago - which is where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it stays physically in that jurisdiction."</seg>
<seg id="27">Many German executives argue that the latest reports are simply confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most prized secrets and these data must therefore be guarded at all costs.</seg>
<seg id="28">That economic spying takes place is not a surprise.</seg>
<seg id="29">It has always taken place.</seg>
<seg id="30">"This has been a topic for many years and hasn't fundamentally changed through the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, chief executive of chemical maker BASF.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Americans spy on us on the commercial and industrial level as we spy on them too, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.</seg>
<seg id="32">Corporate leaders are not generally keen to boast about the countermeasures they have taken, in case this hands an advantage to an attacker.</seg>
<seg id="33">For large companies, the message has long since been drummed home that picking up a free USB stick at a trade fair, or leaving a laptop unguarded in a hotel room are unwise, to say the least.</seg>
<seg id="34">Ulrich Hackenberg, board member at carmaker Audi, says it has been standard practice for years for mobile phones to be collected before board meetings so they cannot be used as remote listening devices.</seg>
<seg id="35">Germany's BfV advises executives to consider using simple prepaid mobiles when on foreign trips because of the risk that smart phones are compromised.</seg>
<seg id="36">The prepaid mobiles are then thrown away afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, there is concern that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.</seg>
<seg id="38">In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their particular niche.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Small and medium sized companies often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources to protect corporate secrets effectively against unauthorised access," the BfV warns in a report.</seg>
<seg id="40">The US warns its own companies about economic espionage by other countries.</seg>
<seg id="41">The US National Intelligence Estimate in February named France alongside Russia and Israel in a second tier of offenders who engage in hacking for economic intelligence, behind China, according to The Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="42">A board member at a German blue-chip company concurred that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."</seg>
<seg id="43">Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, was quoted in an interview this month as saying: "The services know perfectly well that all countries, even as they co-operate in the antiterrorist fight, spy on their allies."</seg>

<seg id="1">Philomena Lee, played by Judi Dench in new film, on why she forgives nuns who stole her son</seg>
<seg id="2">By Philomena Lee</seg>
<seg id="3">Philomena is a film that's left grown men sobbing: the heart-rending story of a naïve Irish girl whose illegitimate son is taken from her at the age of three and adopted by American parents - only for the two of them to spend the rest of their lives searching for each other.</seg>
<seg id="4">What makes it inspirational is that it's all true, and astonishingly the real Philomena feels no bitterness.</seg>
<seg id="5">Here, the still-sprightly 80-year-old grandmother, played on screen by Judi Dench, tells her story . . .</seg>
<seg id="6">True tragedy: Philomena Lee's true story about how her beloved boy was taken from her at a convent has made it onto the silver screen with Judi Dench playing the role of Philomena</seg>
<seg id="7">All this attention is strange and something I am not used to.</seg>
<seg id="8">It seems odd that I spent so many years hiding my secret and now it's all anyone wants to talk to me about.</seg>
<seg id="9">Where to start?</seg>
<seg id="10">The beginning, maybe.</seg>
<seg id="11">I suppose you could say I grew up in a small village in Ireland having no love from anybody really.</seg>
<seg id="12">My mother died of tuberculosis when I was six and my father put me and my three sisters in a convent while he kept my three brothers at home.</seg>
<seg id="13">He didn't really ever come and see us; he was a poor man and only had a bicycle and we were 20 miles away.</seg>
<seg id="14">I left the convent when I was 18 and went to live with an aunt.</seg>
<seg id="15">A few weeks after she took me to a carnival in Limerick.</seg>
<seg id="16">Well, as you can imagine, it was like nothing I had ever seen in my whole life which until then had been full of nuns and praying day and night.</seg>
<seg id="17">Apart: Anthony during his first Christmas in America with his adoptive family</seg>
<seg id="18">It was there that I met John.</seg>
<seg id="19">He bought me a toffee apple and we had a kiss and we did the deed that same day and that was it.</seg>
<seg id="20">I didn't know what I had done because I didn't know what sex was.</seg>
<seg id="21">A few months later my aunt noticed my growing bump.</seg>
<seg id="22">I hadn't - I didn't know anything about the facts of life.</seg>
<seg id="23">You might be thinking I am making it up but this is the truth: when she said, "Are you pregnant?," I said "What's pregnant?"</seg>
<seg id="24">As God is my witness I didn't even know what pregnancy was!</seg>
<seg id="25">I had arranged to meet John the next week, when the carnival came back, but she locked me up and wouldn't let me see him again.</seg>
<seg id="26">He never knew he was a father.</seg>
<seg id="27">All I knew about him was that he worked in the post office in Limerick which meant he was educated.</seg>
<seg id="28">My father and aunt disowned me.</seg>
<seg id="29">My father told my siblings: "I don't want her mentioned again, she's dead!"</seg>
<seg id="30">Only my brother who was closest to me in age knew what had happened - through my aunt, who he was close to - and he got me into the nursing home at Sean Ross Abbey in Roscrea, County Tipperary.</seg>
<seg id="31">My sisters thought I really was dead.</seg>
<seg id="32">I had vanished off the face of the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="33">The baby's birth was painful.</seg>
<seg id="34">He was in the breech position but the nuns at the convent said my pain was my penance and wouldn't let me have painkillers.</seg>
<seg id="35">I thought I was going to die of the pain but they told me I was a sinner, I was like Mary Magdalene.</seg>
<seg id="36">I had committed a mortal sin and I believed I did need to do penance.</seg>
<seg id="37">I had eight weeks to nurse my son, who I called Anthony, and then I was sent to work in the laundry.</seg>
<seg id="38">I would work there unpaid, from 8.30 in the morning until four in the afternoon, and then I would get to spend an hour with my boy.</seg>
<seg id="39">I would sing Anthony Irish ditties and cuddle him.</seg>
<seg id="40">He was such a lovely gentle boy.</seg>
<seg id="41">Most of the nuns weren't that nice but there were a few that were nice in their way.</seg>
<seg id="42">One was my friend and we sang in the choir together - singing was one of the few things that saved me in that place.</seg>
<seg id="43">She took a few pictures of Anthony for me.</seg>
<seg id="44">For nearly 50 years they were all I had of him.</seg>
<seg id="45">I knew that the children there might be adopted and I wanted to leave, but the nuns said my family would have to give them £100.</seg>
<seg id="46">That wasn't going to happen, there was no way they could come up with that sort of money.</seg>
<seg id="47">Anyway, my father wouldn't even acknowledge that I was still alive and I didn't have a single visitor in the three and a half years I was there.</seg>
<seg id="48">I asked them to try to find me a job in the outside world so I could keep Anthony, but they wouldn't help.</seg>
<seg id="49">Even if I had tried to walk out with him there was nowhere to go and the police would have brought me back.</seg>
<seg id="50">A few weeks before Christmas in 1955, when Anthony was three and a half and had my blue eyes and dark hair, my friend the nun came running up to tell me he was being taken.</seg>
<seg id="51">She ran me up the stairs so we could look out the window.</seg>
<seg id="52">That was it - I didn't even have a chance to give him a last cuddle.</seg>
<seg id="53">I saw his little face looking out of the back window of the black car that was taking him away.</seg>
<seg id="54">That's never left me, that image, in all my years.</seg>
<seg id="55">I was there when they filmed that scene for the movie and it was exactly how I remembered it.</seg>
<seg id="56">The director Stephen Frears said: "What are you doing here today, are you mad?"</seg>
<seg id="57">I did shed a tear.</seg>
<seg id="58">Awful.</seg>
<seg id="59">After Anthony was taken, oh, I cried and caused a right carry on.</seg>
<seg id="60">The nuns told me to shut up and to stop being stupid and that I was lucky I had my baby adopted.</seg>
<seg id="61">I was crying day and night - I couldn't stop.</seg>
<seg id="62">We were together for three and a half years and now he was gone.</seg>

<seg id="64">On screen: Judi Dench and Steeve Coogan in new film Philomena detailing Ms Lee's life and search for her long lost son</seg>
<seg id="65">After two weeks, the nuns wanted me to leave.</seg>
<seg id="66">They got me a job in a boy's school in Liverpool run by their order and I suppose you could say it was the start of a different life for me.</seg>
<seg id="67">I came to England and have stayed ever since.</seg>
<seg id="68">I lost my faith in the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="69">I was very bitter, but at least I was out of that place.</seg>
<seg id="70">I did admin work and helped in the school kitchens.</seg>
<seg id="71">After a year, I went on holiday to Ireland to see my brother, who had got me into the nursing home, and I went back to Sean Ross Abbey and asked the nuns to tell me where Anthony had gone - but they refused.</seg>
<seg id="72">I worked in Liverpool for two years and then I had a hankering to do some nursing.</seg>
<seg id="73">My grandmother was a midwife and it might have been in the genes.</seg>
<seg id="74">I became a psychiatric nurse in Hertfordshire and that's what I did for 30 years.</seg>
<seg id="75">It's also where I met my husband John, who was also a nurse.</seg>
<seg id="76">Just before we married in 1959 I told him about Anthony.</seg>
<seg id="77">I was soiled goods and I thought he should know.</seg>
<seg id="78">He said: "What's past is past," and we never talked about it again.</seg>
<seg id="79">I had two children, Kevin and Jane, but I never let Anthony go out of my mind.</seg>
<seg id="80">Once I started psychiatric nursing I discovered what a lot of other sorrow there was in the world.</seg>
<seg id="81">There were some tragic cases and seeing what had happened to them helped me lose my bitterness.</seg>
<seg id="82">The place where I worked in St Albans had been a workhouse before it was a hospital.</seg>
<seg id="83">There were women there who had once been like me; they were sent to the workhouse because they were single mothers but they had never left.</seg>
<seg id="84">They became old and infirm and they stayed for the rest of their days.</seg>
<seg id="85">By the early Sixties people started to treat these women differently.</seg>
<seg id="86">There was an "open door" policy to try to get them out into the community but some of them were so institutionalised they didn't want to leave their wards at all.</seg>
<seg id="87">Gradually, as time went on, I thought I would go back to my religion.</seg>
<seg id="88">I had a neighbour who went to the Abbey in St Albans where they have a Catholic mass every Friday and I started going with her.</seg>
<seg id="89">I haven't been back to confession or communion, I just like going to church to pray.</seg>
<seg id="90">Discoveries: Philomena is pictured in 2004, after finding the grave of her son Anthony, or Michael Hess as his adoptive parents named him</seg>
<seg id="91">I was still thinking about Anthony all the time and praying that he was happy.</seg>
<seg id="92">I had been back to Ireland and Sean Ross Abbey several times and they always refused to tell me anything.</seg>
<seg id="93">I started to think I should tell my children about Anthony.</seg>
<seg id="94">I wasn't to know, but by this time Anthony had already died of Aids.</seg>
<seg id="95">You might think I'm daft, but I think somewhere along the line between this world and up there he managed to get it into my head to tell them.</seg>
<seg id="96">He probably knew I was going to tell them before I did.</seg>
<seg id="97">I broke down and told my daughter, Jane, then 32, on what would have been Anthony's 50th birthday in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="98">She knew what he looked like; she had seen me looking at his photographs when I told her it was my cousin's little boy.</seg>
<seg id="99">She immediately said: "Why didn't you tell me sooner?"</seg>
<seg id="100">But it was so embedded in me that I was a sinner.</seg>
<seg id="101">Don't forget I was with the nuns all my young life and I believed them.</seg>
<seg id="102">Jane immediately started trying to find out what had happened to Anthony.</seg>
<seg id="103">And then we got a call from the society which arranged his adoption saying that Anthony was dead.</seg>
<seg id="104">It felt like I had lost him all over again.</seg>
<seg id="105">But even then they refused to say anything about where he had gone, what his life had been like.</seg>
<seg id="106">Jane found a picture of a gravestone at Sean Ross Abbey on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="107">It had the name Michael Hess but the same birthdate as Anthony and we had a feeling it was him.</seg>
<seg id="108">The inscription read: "Michael A. Hess, a man of two nations and many talents."</seg>
<seg id="109">Born July 5, 1952, Sean Ross Abbey, Roscrea.</seg>
<seg id="110">Died August 15, 1995, Washington DC.</seg>
<seg id="111">We were sure it must be Anthony.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lost time: Anthony, renamed Michael Hess, pictured in 1988 died of Aids in 1995, before his real mother could find him</seg>
<seg id="113">So now we needed someone to help us find out about his life in America.</seg>
<seg id="114">That's where Martin Sixsmith came in.</seg>
<seg id="115">A journalist who had been a foreign correspondent with the BBC, and a former press officer for the Government, he had the right contacts.</seg>
<seg id="116">A friend of Jane's who met him at a party put him in touch with us.</seg>
<seg id="117">Martin went to America on his own (not with me, as in the film) and he found Anthony's adoptive sister, Mary, and his partner Pete Nilsson.</seg>
<seg id="118">Pete came to London and he was lovely.</seg>
<seg id="119">He brought me lots of pictures and memorabilia and gave me Anthony's Celtic ring which I wear every day.</seg>
<seg id="120">It turned out Anthony was adopted by a professional couple from Missouri and had done so well for himself.</seg>
<seg id="121">He became a top lawyer for the American government, working closely with Ronald Reagan and George Bush.</seg>
<seg id="122">But Pete said he had a difficult relationship with his adoptive mother and he missed me.</seg>
<seg id="123">The saddest thing to learn was that he had been to Sean Ross Abbey to find me and was told they knew nothing about me, in the same way they had told me they knew nothing about him.</seg>
<seg id="124">I can accept some of what they did; they really did think I was a sinner and should be punished.</seg>
<seg id="125">I can't condemn them.</seg>
<seg id="126">But the part that hurts me the most is that he went to see them, for the third time, when he was a dying man.</seg>
<seg id="127">They didn't just refuse to put him in touch - they told him I had abandoned him at birth.</seg>
<seg id="128">I think that was evil.</seg>
<seg id="129">But maybe there was a part of him that didn't believe them; that's why he asked for his ashes to be buried there.</seg>
<seg id="130">He told Pete "One day my mum will find me."</seg>
<seg id="131">And he was right.</seg>
<seg id="132">At that stage I was content to know that he had a good life and I had found him.</seg>
<seg id="133">I didn't know Martin was going to bring out a book.</seg>
<seg id="134">And now there is a film, with that lovely lady Dame Judi Dench playing me.</seg>
<seg id="135">My goodness.</seg>
<seg id="136">The first we knew of it was when I got a phone call from Martin saying Steve Coogan was interested in making a film.</seg>
<seg id="137">I didn't know much about him.</seg>
<seg id="138">In fact, I got him mixed up with Rob Brydon.</seg>
<seg id="139">When Steve, who plays Martin, said he wanted to get Judi Dench to play me I didn't think it was real.</seg>
<seg id="140">I love watching her on TV in As Time Goes By and all the Bond films.</seg>
<seg id="141">Jane said to me: "Mum, that means Judi Dench knows who you are!," and we just laughed.</seg>
<seg id="142">She is such a beautiful lady.</seg>
<seg id="143">Well, soon I was going for lunch with Judi.</seg>
<seg id="144">She had lots of questions but we talked about other things, too.</seg>
<seg id="145">We both can't stand cooking so we swapped easy recipes.</seg>
<seg id="146">I was so at ease with her.</seg>
<seg id="147">I saw the film a few weeks ago and it still doesn't feel real.</seg>
<seg id="148">I come across as a bit of a dumb clock in it - an Irish term for a silly billy - and I suppose that's what I am really.</seg>
<seg id="149">I know they had to put some humour in it and they say "There is no way we think you are silly."</seg>
<seg id="150">I still don't know whether it is any good but people seem to like it.</seg>
<seg id="151">I am trying not to show everyone how apprehensive I am about the whole thing.</seg>
<seg id="152">I don't know what people will think of it.</seg>
<seg id="153">It's just my story.</seg>
<seg id="154">For me the most important thing was finding Anthony.</seg>
<seg id="155">At least now I know he is at rest.</seg>
<seg id="156">I hope he is at peace and I think he is in heaven.</seg>
<seg id="157">I feel like he is watching over me.</seg>
<seg id="158">Philomena is out now</seg>

<seg id="1">$325m rescue package for Tassie health</seg>
<seg id="2">The Federal Government insists a $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's ailing health system has tough conditions attached that will ensure the State Government can't waste the funds.</seg>
<seg id="3">Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced the Commonwealth is taking "urgent action" to head off a crisis caused by the island state's aging population, higher rates of chronic disease and system constraints.</seg>
<seg id="4">The funding, over four years, was decided after government consultations with Tasmanian independent MP Andrew Wilkie.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The Government has come up with an emergency rescue package we believe will address the unique challenges faced by the state," Ms Plibersek said today.</seg>
<seg id="6">The $325 million package includes a $31 million elective surgery blitz.</seg>
<seg id="7">An additional 2600 operations including orthopedic and cataract surgery will help clear a backlog.</seg>
<seg id="8">There's also money for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better after-hospital care, medical specialist training, mental health services and the rollout of personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="9">"These investments respond to the ideas that front-line clinicians have told me will be the best ways to tend to Tasmania's health system," Ms Plibersek said.</seg>
<seg id="10">The minister insisted the Tasmanian Government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.</seg>
<seg id="11">The state would have to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth cash and report monthly on where it was spending the extra funds.</seg>
<seg id="12">A three-person commission will be set up to ensure the state is delivering services as effectively and efficiently as possible.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr Wilkie today said the $325 million would count for little "unless it's followed by genuine reform to put Tasmania's public health system on a more sustainable footing."</seg>
<seg id="14">He nevertheless praised the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance which he first raised with the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I'm hopeful the federal assistance package will go a long way towards taking the state's public health system off the critical list," Mr Wilkie said.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the State Government these additional elective procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts.</seg>
<seg id="17">But federal Opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is a "band-aid solution."</seg>
<seg id="18">"The reason we are here is that the Labor State Government ripped $430 million out of its health system," he told ABC TV.</seg>
<seg id="19">You can't have a state government ripping out almost half-a-billion dollars and the Commonwealth put in $300 million and pretend it's a good news day.</seg>
<seg id="20">Mr Dutton called on Ms Plibersek to guarantee that not one dollar out of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.</seg>

<seg id="1">Kings' Anze Kopitar has last word against San Jose Sharks, 4-3</seg>
<seg id="2">His arms thrust high ... and just like that, the weight seemed to lift off the shoulders of a jubilant Anze Kopitar after his second goal of the season.</seg>
<seg id="3">Nothing quite like an overtime goal against the league's best team to do the trick.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Kings center had broken a season-long scoring drought last week, but his game-winner on the power play at 2 minutes 32 seconds was in a different category, leading the Kings to a 4-3 victory against the San Jose Sharks in overtime on Wednesday night at Staples Center.</seg>
<seg id="5">Kopitar, who has scored three game-winners in overtime in his career, also set up the tying goal, by Justin Williams, in the third period, also on the power play at 12:21.</seg>
<seg id="6">Williams had a goal and an assist, Mike Richards added two assists and the other two Kings goals came from defenseman Drew Doughty and center Jarret Stoll, who also scored in Tuesday's loss against the Coyotes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Beyond the basics is another stunning statistic: The Kings have not lost when the game has extended beyond regulation.</seg>
<seg id="8">They've won four times in shootouts and twice in overtime.</seg>
<seg id="9">This was a true measuring stick-type game.</seg>
<seg id="10">Fourteen games into a lengthy NHL season is as good a time for a legitimate test for the Kings as any occasion.</seg>
<seg id="11">Presenting the Sharks: not quite this season's Chicago Blackhawks, but close enough with just one loss in regulation in 12 games before Wednesday night.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Kings were attempting to make it two losses in regulation in 13 games but stumbled early, regained their footing and finally equalized in the third period when Williams scored on the power play to make it 3-3.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I think it's no surprise it's going to be a great game like that," Stoll said in a TV interview after the game.</seg>
<seg id="14">You could tell we were pushing and pushing....</seg>
<seg id="15">Great shot.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was good to see.</seg>
<seg id="17">Kopi can find those holes.</seg>
<seg id="18">We found a way to get a win.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stoll also has started to find his scoring touch.</seg>
<seg id="20">"It feels good to contribute and chip in.... We're not going to win with one or two lines," he said.</seg>
<seg id="21">San Jose center Logan Couture set up the first goal and scored the Sharks' third goal on the power play late in the second period.</seg>
<seg id="22">The other Sharks goals came from Marc-Edouard Vlasic and Joe Pavelski.</seg>
<seg id="23">This was the first meeting between the teams since their electric playoff series in the Western Conference semifinals in late May.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Kings won that battle in seven games, clinching the series at Staples Center.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Sharks went off to the lake, retooled and refreshed and have pretty much run the table in October, losing only once in regulation, at Boston on Oct.</seg>
<seg id="26">Somehow, it was fitting that Williams was the one to extend the game.</seg>
<seg id="27">After all, he was the playoff hero of Game 7, scoring twice in that one to send the Kings to the conference final.</seg>
<seg id="28">That was only one of the few similarities to Game 7.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Sharks and Kings had their share of October-type miscues.</seg>
<seg id="30">San Jose took two bench minors, including the one leading to the Williams goal.</seg>
<seg id="31">And the Kings committed three offensive-zone penalties, and the last could have been costly.</seg>
<seg id="32">They had just tied the game when left wing Daniel Carcillo went off for boarding Couture at 14:30, one of his typical ill-advised adventures.</seg>
<seg id="33">But the Kings dug deep and killed off the penalty and managed to push the game into overtime.</seg>
<seg id="34">These were the moments designed to create sleepless nights for coaches.</seg>
<seg id="35">Or, at the very least, sure to create many future video sessions for attentive players.</seg>

<seg id="1">Portuguese parliament backs austerity budget</seg>
<seg id="2">Portugal's lawmakers have given outline approval to a budget bill for 2014 that slashes spending on state pensions, public sector wages, healthcare and education.</seg>
<seg id="3">As it was presented, protesters in the public gallery chanted "Government - out!" before being removed by police.</seg>
<seg id="4">Deputy Prime Minister Paulo Portas warned the budget has to be approved if the country is to exit the economic crisis: "Portugal cannot go back to a time of wasteful spending and endless debt."</seg>
<seg id="5">It simply cannot.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because if we do that we would have to abandon the euro and we would be on our own in the world, chasing a fantasy of self-sufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="7">Spending will be cut by almost 3.2 billion euros - which is 2.3 percent of Portugal's gross domestic product - with the target of getting the budget deficit down to four percent of GDP, from a forecast 5.9 percent this year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Among the measures, public sector workers earning over 600 euros a month will have their wages cut by between 2.5 percent and 12 percent.</seg>
<seg id="9">After discussion, a final vote on the budget bill will be held on November 26, but it will then almost certainly be reviewed by the country's Constitutional Court, which has rejected previous government austerity measures forcing the politicians to come up with alternative ways of cutting spending.</seg>
<seg id="10">Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho said the government was convinced the bill was constitutional.</seg>
<seg id="11">"There is no clear violation of the constitution in any of the measures proposed... My conviction is that the government was within the boundaries of the constitutional interpretation that matches the reality we live in," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Masters winner Adam Scott took an early look at the Australian PGA course</seg>
<seg id="2">Adam Scott is back in Australia for the PGA.</seg>
<seg id="3">ADAM Scott is a $45 million-a-year industry yet it was playing for a humble $10 Lotto ticket on the Gold Coast on Friday which showed the pure love for golf of the Masters champion.</seg>
<seg id="4">A workman at Royal Pines shouted "gidday" and there were double-takes aplenty by fellow golfers as the world No.2 materialised unexpectedly for a low-key round at the scene of the Australian PGA starting on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scott partnered father Phil, himself a PGA professional, in a laugh-filled 18-hole reconnaissance which came with a serious side - duelling with Scott's old schoolboy buddies Aaron Nye, the former Queensland cricketer, and Adam King.</seg>
<seg id="6">Dad and I cleaned them up.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Aaron and Adam are both pretty good golfers but as their careers grow, their golf gets worse," Scott said with a grin.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hopefully I keep getting better and the gap widens.</seg>
<seg id="9">I've won a $10 Lotto ticket but they are trying to get out of this with the cheapest QuickPick they can find.</seg>
<seg id="10">Good humoured and grounded as ever, Scott's popularity is not just because of the green jacket he won but the grace to his all-on-the-line success at Augusta when he became Australia's first Masters champion in April.</seg>
<seg id="11">The green jacket is with me.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It's been hung in a lot of hotel closets this year because one of the cool things is taking it everywhere with you and being able to show it off, which I plan to do in Australia," Scott said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Adam Scott, of Australia, celebrates with his green jacket after winning the Masters golf tournament.</seg>
<seg id="14">I was overwhelmed by the support from Australia with the Masters so I've been looking forward to sharing it.</seg>
<seg id="15">He is sure to be wearing it when Gold Coast mayor Tom Tate presents Scott with the key to the city just after midday on Wednesday by the 18th hole on pro-am day.</seg>
<seg id="16">Scott's 12.30pm slot was unannounced so the magnetic personality who galvanised millions of sports-loving Aussies with his Masters triumph was able to tee off at the 10th with an audience of three.</seg>
<seg id="17">Tournament organisers are excited that record crowds will flock from Thursday to Royal Pines, a layout ripe for a seven-under-par 64 from Scott or a similar birdie barrage from American drawcards Brandt Snedeker and Rickie Fowler.</seg>
<seg id="18">"I had maybe five or six birdies out there but the greens are tricky to read so that's where a player is maybe going to separate himself from the field," Scott said.</seg>
<seg id="19">Aussie golfers Adam Scott and Jason Day.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Queenslander flew in secretly on Tuesday to maximise his time out of the spotlight as Adam Scott, brother, uncle, son and friend, rather than sought-after superstar.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was BRW's Young Rich list which recently pegged the Scott juggernaut on and off course at $45 million for 2013.</seg>
<seg id="22">A cold recently picked up in Europe has prevented him yet indulging in his head-clearing passion for surfing but he has fallen for the new babe in his life at Sanctuary Cove where he and his family lives.</seg>
<seg id="23">She is niece Olivia, the two-month-old daughter of sister Casie and brother-in-law coach Brad.</seg>
<seg id="24">She's the sweetest little thing, so well behaved.</seg>
<seg id="25">"I didn't make her cry, which is a good thing," Scott said.</seg>
<seg id="26">Scott ripped a driver and seven iron downwind to 4m on the 460m par four ninth, the hole with the greatest teeth at Royal Pines so if he gets his Mercedes-smooth game humming, look out.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mozambique security concerns mount as powerful personalities clash</seg>
<seg id="2">With a statue of Samora Machel, Mozambique's founding president, staring down on them, thousands of people gathered in central Maputo to chant peace slogans in a rare public demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="3">"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, chief executive of an investment company.</seg>
<seg id="4">Fearful about the future of her country, she swapped her corporate attire for a T-shirt emblazoned with "we demand security" in Portuguese as she joined the crowds in the capital's Independence Square on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="5">For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, some of the worst skirmishes since a peace deal more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially backed by white-ruled Rhodesia and then South Africa's apartheid government as part of efforts to destabilise the country's independent government.</seg>
<seg id="7">After a 1992 peace deal, it became an opposition party.</seg>
<seg id="8">Analysts believe the country is unlikely to slide back into full-blown conflict, but recent events have unnerved foreign investors and locals.</seg>
<seg id="9">The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could bring in more than $50bn of investment over the next few next years from companies including Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the US.</seg>
<seg id="10">The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tension.</seg>
<seg id="11">Renamo says the government initiated the latest clashes by launching an attack on its members in Sofala province, traditionally a Renamo stronghold, on October 17.</seg>
<seg id="12">Assaults on the former rebels then escalated as government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, Fernando Mazanga, Renamo's spokesman, told the Financial Times.</seg>
<seg id="13">The government blames Renamo for triggering the clashes, accusing it of attacking soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="14">President Armando Guebuza has sought to play down concerns about instability.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Guebuza told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama saw himself as a "loser" who wanted to use "whatever remains of his forces to try to prove that he can impose on the government his own decisions."</seg>
<seg id="16">Both Frelimo and Renamo insist they want to avoid war.</seg>
<seg id="17">But concerns have grown after Mr Mazanga was quoted as saying Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace accord.</seg>
<seg id="18">He told the FT that he meant the agreement was no longer being respected by Frelimo.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Our vision is to come back to negotiations, but with seriousness," Mr Mazanga said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions fuelled by a series of clashes this year.</seg>
<seg id="21">"It's two big men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) butting heads together," said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert.</seg>
<seg id="22">Neither of them are good negotiators and neither of them are prepared to make the kind of concessions that are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="23">Renamo, which has been pushing for electoral reforms, had already said that it would boycott municipal elections due in November.</seg>
<seg id="24">Presidential and parliamentary polls are scheduled for next year.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as the attempt of an ailing movement to win concessions and financial spoils from the government.</seg>
<seg id="26">Renamo's share of the vote has been declining since 1992, while a newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) which was formed by a former Renamo member, is expected to improve its showing at the elections.</seg>
<seg id="27">Mr Mazanga says Mr Guebuza - who is due to step down when his second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country's democracy.</seg>
<seg id="28">"He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency," Mr Mazanga said.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is unclear how much capacity Renamo has, but it has carried out disruptive hit-and-run attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key north-south highway.</seg>
<seg id="30">Most of the skirmishes have taken place in Sofala province, which is several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but hosts Beira, the port that miners, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely on to export coal.</seg>
<seg id="31">In June, Rio suspended its use of the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the line.</seg>
<seg id="32">Mr Mazanga was coy when asked about whether Renamo would repeat this threat.</seg>
<seg id="33">Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things were not going well in Mozambique," Mr Mazanga said.</seg>
<seg id="34">The instability has added to frustrations with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, with many people also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and a recent spate of kidnappings.</seg>
<seg id="35">"People think the ones responsible for the future of the country are the government and the president, and he should be the one to find solutions for the problems," he says.</seg>
<seg id="36">Omar Sultuane, a demonstrator, said people just wanted stability.</seg>
<seg id="37">"No one cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace again, they want free access to the roads," he said.</seg>

<seg id="2">1 November 2013 Last updated at 01:02</seg>
<seg id="3">Death rates from prostate cancer in Scotland have fallen by 18% in the past 20 years, according to figures compiled by a leading charity.</seg>
<seg id="4">Cancer Research UK (CRUK) said the downward trend is largely the result of new approaches to treating the cancer.</seg>
<seg id="5">Each year 2,700 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer in Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="6">From a peak in the early 1990s when there were about 29 deaths per 100,000 men in the population, there are now about 24 deaths per 100,000.</seg>
<seg id="7">The charity said the improved treatment includes earlier and more widespread use of hormone therapy, radical surgery and radiotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="8">It also cited earlier diagnosis linked to the use of the PSA test.</seg>
<seg id="9">Prof Hing Leung of CRUK, who is based at the Beatson Institute in Glasgow, said: "This new report shows we've come a long way in improving the treatment of prostate cancer in the last couple of decades."</seg>
<seg id="10">And improvements in how we treat prostate cancer have been key to reducing deaths of men diagnosed with the disease.</seg>
<seg id="11">""But a lot more work still needs to be done.</seg>
<seg id="12">Martin Ledwick, CRUK's head information nurse, said: "The symptoms for prostate cancer are similar to a number of benign and harmless conditions but it's worth being aware of them and getting anything unusual checked out with your GP."</seg>
<seg id="13">""Things such as having to rush to the toilet to pass urine and difficulty urinating should be checked out, especially if it's getting you up several times during the night.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's also worth remembering prostate cancer is more common in men over the age 60, anyone who has had a relative diagnosed with the disease and men of African-Caribbean descent.</seg>

<seg id="1">Schools urged to focus more on maths, spelling and grammar</seg>
<seg id="2">English literature courses will require pupils to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th century novel, Romantic poetry and contemporary British fiction from 1914 onwards.</seg>
<seg id="3">The exam will also feature "unseen texts" to encourage wider reading;</seg>
<seg id="4">A combined English literature and language course will be scrapped.</seg>
<seg id="5">From 2015, pupils will be required to take a standalone GCSE in language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Department for Education is due to release the new syllabuses in English and maths tomorrow - the first subjects to undergo a radical overhaul.</seg>
<seg id="7">It will make changes in other core subjects next year.</seg>
<seg id="8">In a separate move, Ofqual, the exams regulator, will unveil a shake-up of the structure of GCSEs, with a new grading system and less coursework.</seg>
<seg id="9">Speaking in the summer, Michael Gove, the Education Secretary, said there was a "widespread consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence," insisting GCSEs would be "more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous."</seg>
<seg id="10">Studies show that English schools devote less time to maths - 116 hours a year or three hours a week during term time - than in most countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">By comparison, Australian schools provide an average of 143 hours a year and pupils do around 138 hours in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="12">While there will be no formal requirement to devote more of the timetable to maths, Coalition sources said the extensive maths GCSE - combined with more weighting for the subject in league tables - was likely to encourage schools to provide extra teaching.</seg>
<seg id="13">The syllabus will place a greater focus on "real world problems," including financial mathematics.</seg>

<seg id="2">In a major victory for the Obama administration, the US Supreme Court today ruled Barack Obama's signature health care law is constitutional.</seg>
<seg id="3">By a 5-4 vote, the justices ruled the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's individual mandate - which requires citizens to buy health insurance by 2014 or else pay a penalty - was constitutional under the taxing power of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the court while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy dissented.</seg>
<seg id="5">The court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2700 page law, and further held that the health care law's requirement that states increase Medicaid eligibility or else lose all federal Medicaid funding is not unconstitutionally coercive.</seg>
<seg id="6">The suit to block the law was brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.</seg>
<seg id="7">The law was vigorously opposed by each of the major Republican presidential candidates during the 2012 primary season, including presumptive nominee Mitt Romney.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scottish League Cup: Hamill eager for ICT clash</seg>
<seg id="2">HEARTS midfielder Jamie Hamill believes setting up a League Cup semi-final against Inverness can kick-start their season as he continued to revel in their derby victory.</seg>
<seg id="3">Hearts drawn to face Inverness while Aberdeen will play St Johnstone</seg>
<seg id="4">The administration-hit club's reward for dumping Hibernian out of the tournament is a repeat of their last-four clash last season while Aberdeen will play St Johnstone in the other tie.</seg>
<seg id="5">Hearts could face a return to Easter Road on February 1-2 after beating Caley Thistle on penalties at that venue earlier this year before losing to St Mirren in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">And Hamill could not resist a dig at his city rivals after helping secure some much-needed joy for the Hearts fans.</seg>
<seg id="7">Hamill said: "It's great to have a repeat of last year's semi-final."</seg>
<seg id="8">It's in February so it's still a wee while away and hopefully we can pick up a few points between now and then.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I wouldn't like to be in Hibs" shoes at the moment."</seg>
<seg id="10">When you can come to Hampden and be a part of the draw, it's really good and hopefully we can have more of the same in the next round.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hearts returned to the 15-points deficit they started the season with following their 2-0 defeat by Kilmarnock last weekend, which left them with just a point from their last seven Scottish Premiership games.</seg>
<seg id="12">But Hamill believes their unexpected cup triumph can spark a revival among Gary Locke's youthful side.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The gaffer had drilled into us that the Hibs game could be a turning point for us," he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">(Winning the cup) would be a massive achievement with the situation we are in and the administration.</seg>
<seg id="15">It's a difficult one.</seg>
<seg id="16">The gaffer is on a tight budget as well at the moment with the squad.</seg>
<seg id="17">But hopefully this can kick-start the season and we can pick up results.</seg>
<seg id="18">Being in the semi-final of the cup with the squad we've got at the moment is really good.</seg>
<seg id="19">Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes suspected he would face his former club after his side recovered from Joe Shaughnessy's early red card to win 2-0 at Motherwell.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I had a funny feeling we might have got St Johnstone," he said.</seg>
<seg id="21">When it comes round we have just got to make sure we are in a good frame of mind.</seg>
<seg id="22">It's three months away, which is a bit bizarre but hopefully we can be on decent form going into it.</seg>
<seg id="23">There is plenty to keep us busy but it's nice to have that on the backburner, that we've got a semi-final to look forward to and the players deserve that opportunity, and results and performances like last night certainly help us going forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">St Johnstone manager Tommy Wright, whose side won 1-0 at Morton, added: "Whoever we got was going to be tough."</seg>
<seg id="25">"Probably of the four clubs that are left in, Aberdeen are the biggest club and probably the bookies" favourites so it will be a difficult tie."</seg>
<seg id="26">We haven't won the League Cup or Scottish Cup so to get to the final or win the final would be tremendous.</seg>
<seg id="27">When we told the players last night that it wasn't until February 1-2, they were a wee bit disappointed.</seg>
<seg id="28">So they have got something to look forward to.</seg>
<seg id="29">There is a long way to go before then and there is a transfer window so both squads could change before then.</seg>
<seg id="30">The semi-final ties will be played on the weekend of February 1 and 2, at venues which have yet to be confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="31">The final is scheduled for Sunday, March 16.</seg>

<seg id="2">Trainer Peter Snowden, left, with son Paul at their Flemington stables yesterday with Victoria Derby runners Tupac Amaru, far left, Complacent and San Diego.</seg>
<seg id="3">Picture: Colleen Petch Source: TheAustralian</seg>
<seg id="4">SYDNEY three-year-old form is rated more highly than that of their Melbourne counterparts and with trainer Peter Snowden of the opinion the best of his trio has improved since his last run, Complacent is the horse to beat in the $1.5 million Victoria Derby (2500m) at Flemington.</seg>
<seg id="5">Complacent outstayed Criterion and Savvy Nature in the Group I Spring Champion Stakes (2000m) at Randwick on October 12, putting his stamp on the race over the last 200m.</seg>
<seg id="6">Within a week of that victory, he was transferred to Darley's Melbourne stable.</seg>
<seg id="7">He had a look at Moonee Valley, but Snowden bypassed the Mitchelton Vase to go directly into today's classic.</seg>
<seg id="8">Savvy Nature won the lead-up race at Moonee Valley, bolstering the already impressive form around Complacent, whose biggest stumbling block may be barrier 16 rather than the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="9">"It's not ideal, but he's been lucky with draws in Sydney so I really can't complain about drawing out in the car park," Snowden said on RSN.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's not a good start with the run to the first corner.</seg>
<seg id="11">It's important that he gets in and that Kerrin (McEvoy) doesn't have to rev him up too much to get him into a good spot.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's a big field.</seg>
<seg id="13">Luck will play a big part, no doubt, going out of the straight the first time," he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">I won't be tying Kerrin down to too many instructions.</seg>
<seg id="15">He knows the horse inside out.</seg>
<seg id="16">He'll just do enough to try and get a midfield spot or a tad closer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The important thing is to have him relax.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 2500m is new to all of these horses.</seg>
<seg id="19">Just have him where he is happy and don't have him overracing.</seg>
<seg id="20">Glen Boss rides Bring Something, an outside chance, but yesterday he was conceding the race to Complacent if he holds his form at start six of what has been an amazing first racing preparation.</seg>
<seg id="21">If I was riding Complacent tomorrow, I'd be very confident</seg>
<seg id="22">I just win the race," Boss said yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="23">I'd be sleeping pretty comfortably if I was Kerrin McEvoy tonight, thinking that I could win the derby.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The trip looks like it will be the least of his worries and I reckon he'll love Flemington," Boss said.</seg>
<seg id="25">He's well found in the market but he should be because he just looks like the winner to me.</seg>
<seg id="26">Bring Something was fourth in the Bill Stutt Stakes, won by Caulfield Guineas runner-up Divine Calling, who narrowly beat Cox Plate winner Shamus Award, at Moonee Valley under lights.</seg>
<seg id="27">He then finished fifth in the Norman Robinson behind Polanski.</seg>
<seg id="28">"I'm expecting my horse to run well and I think in the autumn when he furnishes you'll see a better horse," Boss said.</seg>
<seg id="29">I can't see him winning tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope he does, but I can't see it.</seg>
<seg id="31">I've got him in the top five, but outside the top three.</seg>
<seg id="32">San Diego, one of three derby runners prepared by Peter Snowden, was second in the Norman Robinson.</seg>
<seg id="33">A subsequent gear change - the fitting of a norton bit - has worked wonders.</seg>
<seg id="34">It's changed his whole demeanour round.</seg>
<seg id="35">He's stopped pulling and he is walking everywhere and not jig-jogging," Snowden said.</seg>
<seg id="36">Everything about the horse has come right at the right time.</seg>
<seg id="37">Tupac Amaru can definitely stay but is very dour, Snowden said, suggesting he needed to race slightly closer than he had been.</seg>
<seg id="38">Polanski, a $4000 purchase that has won $250,000 so far, has won two lead-up races - it rates</seg>
<seg id="39">a serious chance from barrier one.</seg>

<seg id="1">Halloween witch: celebrated with a Google Doodle</seg>
<seg id="2">The name Halloween is a shortening of All Hallows" Even, or All Hallows" Evening.</seg>
<seg id="3">All Hallows is an old term for All Saints" Day.</seg>
<seg id="4">Halloween seems to have grown around the ancient Gaelic festival of Samhain, marking the end of the light half of the year and the beginning of the dark half.</seg>
<seg id="5">Samhain was in part a sort of harvest festival, when the last crops were gathered in for the winter, and livestock killed and stored.</seg>
<seg id="6">Would you let your children go trick or treating?</seg>
<seg id="7">But the pagan Celts also believed it was a time when the walls between our world and the next became thin and porous, allowing spirits to pass through.</seg>
<seg id="8">The practice of donning a scary costume may have stemmed from this belief, and the idea that dressing up as a ghost may have scared away other ghosts.</seg>
<seg id="9">The classic Hallowe'en jack-o"-lantern, a carved grinning pumpkin, seems to have come from an old Irish legend of a man called Stingy Jack, a miserly farmer who played a trick on the devil and as punishment was cursed to wander the earth, lighting his way with a candle inside a hollowed-out turnip.</seg>
<seg id="10">When the tradition moved to America pumpkins were used instead of turnips, as they were both more available and easier to carve.</seg>

<seg id="4">The travel company now expects its full year underlying profit before tax to be between $325 million and $340 million, compared with the $305 million to $315 million it previously forecast.</seg>

<seg id="8">This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which are typically our largest profit generators.</seg>

<seg id="1">New Class Action Claim Against Holy Cross Brothers</seg>
<seg id="2">A new class action claim has been filed against the brothers of the Congregation of the Holy Cross involving sexual assaults, allegedly carried out, this time, at the Saint-Joseph Oratory and several orphanages, colleges and schools.</seg>
<seg id="3">The claim is based on the testimony of an applicant identified as "J. J", who would have been masturbated in the 1950s, first at Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher, Brother Soumis, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the Saint-Joseph Oratory, where he was an altar boy and where his father worked as a painter.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The first action involved only three institutions, and when the ruling was announced, many people said to us: 'I was assaulted at so and so place, can I add my name?" says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who is defending the victims in the two actions.</seg>
<seg id="5">The class action that has just been filed specifically enables the inclusion of plaintiffs from any institution where members of the Congregation of the Holy Cross may have been involved in abuses.</seg>
<seg id="6">Currently, the action combines the complaints of 25 individuals who claim to have been assaulted by the brothers of the Holy Cross.</seg>
<seg id="7">The alleged deeds generally took place before those cited in the first action as many of the institutions concerned were closed in the 1960s.</seg>
<seg id="8">Moreover, the action specifies that the Congregation of the Holy Cross and the Saint-Joseph Oratory, which is a separate entity, "allowed acts of sexual abuse to be committed against children", that they "exercised moral, religious and psychological constraint over the victims," and that they "knew about sexual assaults committed but kept quiet" and "deliberately and consciously chose to ignore the problem".</seg>
<seg id="9">The latter accusations are partly based on letters written by the lawyer of the brothers of the Holy Cross, Mr Emile Perrin QC, in the 1990s, as well as through research carried out in the archives on this subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of the Holy Cross who has publicly denounced the abuses.</seg>
<seg id="10">The class action must first be deemed admissible by the Superior Court.</seg>
<seg id="11">Once the Court has declared it admissible, it will proceed to the second stage, the preliminary hearings.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the first action, the Congregation of the Holy Cross agreed to settle out of court before preliminary hearings were conducted.</seg>

<seg id="2">Jack Riewoldt makes a point at Richmond training.</seg>
<seg id="3">JACK Riewoldt insists no one at Richmond has a problem with his attitude or the way he behaved during Friday's loss to Fremantle.</seg>
<seg id="4">Riewoldt spoke yesterday of his disappointment in his own performance against the Dockers, in which he kicked one goal and collected just 10 possessions.</seg>
<seg id="5">A story in yesterday's Herald Sun questioned Riewoldt's body language, while triple premiership forward Mark Maclure labelled the forward a "prima donna."</seg>
<seg id="6">The 24-year-old said the fact he wore his heart on his sleeve could "definitely" be misconstrued.</seg>
<seg id="7">I'm an emotional person ...</seg>
<seg id="8">"I play with emotion and I reckon I'd be a pretty boring person and a pretty boring player if I didn't do that," Riewoldt said at Etihad Stadium, where he was announced as an ambassador for "Mac Pack," a McDonald's program that encourages participation in junior sport.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's a double-edged sword (in the) AFL.</seg>
<seg id="10">There's definitely cries for players to have a bit more personality, but if you show a bit of personality, you can be shot down pretty quickly.</seg>
<seg id="11">""I'm an easy target, I know that.""</seg>
<seg id="12">This is not the first time Riewoldt's attitude has been questioned.</seg>
<seg id="13">Premiership coach Paul Roos said last year Riewoldt would be testing Tigers boss Damien Hardwick's patience with his on-field behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="14">"In Round 2, 2011, he argued with club officials for substituting him out of a game because of concussion and a week later he gave the "bird" to the Hawthorn bench."</seg>
<seg id="15">That prompted Hawks legend Jason Dunstall to publicly warn Riewoldt he risked being remembered for all the wrong reasons.</seg>
<seg id="16">""I might be being pigeon-holed a little bit like that I reckon," Riewoldt said yesterday when asked if his attitude issues remained."</seg>
<seg id="17">""But I'm always trying to work to become a better leader.</seg>
<seg id="18">I'm in the leadership group, I try to go out there and lead the football club that I love as best as possible.</seg>
<seg id="19">How someone in the media portrays what I'm doing to how I'm portraying it is obviously completely different.</seg>
<seg id="20">The two-time Coleman medallist said he had not been spoken to by Hardwick or captain Trent Cotchin about his attitude on Friday night.</seg>
<seg id="21">And he said comments from anyone outside of the club did not resonate with him.</seg>

<seg id="23">But it can definitely affect your family and I think that's where people have got to be really careful about what they are saying.</seg>
<seg id="24">Riewoldt, out of contract at season's end, said he hoped to sign a new deal with the Tigers soon.</seg>
<seg id="25">He said the sudden departure of former football manager Craig Cameron before the season had put back negotiations between the club and his manager Liam Pickering.</seg>
<seg id="26">"I think any player wants to get their contract over and done with and their future set in stone as quick as possible," Riewoldt said.</seg>
<seg id="27">That will happen as soon as it happens.</seg>
<seg id="28">It's definitely no distraction for us.</seg>

<seg id="4">THE Australian Ambassador to Indonesia Greg Moriarty has described his meeting with Indonesian officials over claims the Jakarta embassy was being used as a spy base as positive, but has refused to provide any more details of the sensitive discussions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr Moriarty met with Indonesian Foreign Ministry Secretary-General Budi Bowoleksono for 20 minutes on Friday after being summoned to answer questions over allegations the Australian embassy was part of a spy network that has been secretly intercepting calls and data across Asia.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's been alleged the embassy was being used to spy on terrorists and people smugglers in Indonesia, but also target "political, diplomatic and economic" interests.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Indonesian Foreign Ministry refused to comment following the brief meeting after earlier issuing a statement saying any such surveillance would be "considered a serious breach of security which cannot be accepted."</seg>
<seg id="8">It's been reported that surveillance collection facilities are in place at embassies in Jakarta, Bangkok, Hanoi, Beijing and Dili, and high commissions in Kuala Lumpur and Port Moresby - without the knowledge of diplomats.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some of the details are in a secret US National Security Agency (NSA) document leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden and published by Germany's Der Spiegel magazine.</seg>
<seg id="10">The document reveals the existence of a signals intelligence collection program - codenamed STATEROOM - conducted from sites at US embassies and consulates and from the diplomatic missions of other intelligence partners including Australia, Britain and Canada.</seg>
<seg id="11">The document says the Australian Defence Signals Directorate operates STATEROOM facilities "at Australian diplomatic facilities."</seg>
<seg id="12">A former Australian Defence Intelligence officer has told Fairfax Media the directorate conducts surveillance operations from Australian embassies across Asia and the Pacific.</seg>
<seg id="13">On his way into a meeting with his Australian counterpart Julie Bishop in Perth, Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa said using the embassy to spy is "not cricket."</seg>

<seg id="1">Institutions shift to growth assets</seg>
<seg id="2">Europe has become the focus as big investors look to take advantage of its recovery Source: AP</seg>
<seg id="3">IS capital growth back in vogue?</seg>
<seg id="4">That certainly would seem to be the case, based on the preferred asset allocation strategies of institutional fund managers in the US, Europe and Australia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Six to eight months ago, most fund managers still were firmly focused on yield.</seg>
<seg id="6">The aim of the game was to lock in holdings that delivered good income returns, with high-yielding stocks with stable or rising earnings top of the list.</seg>
<seg id="7">But that game has changed somewhat in recent months, with the smell of global economic recovery (despite the fragility of the present US debt repayment plan) spurring a shift towards undervalued stocks with strong capital growth potential.</seg>
<seg id="8">As well as equities, investors are shifting into alternative investments such as infrastructure, hedge funds and private equity.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's more, institutional investors are reducing exposure to US equities and bonds while increasing exposure to Europe, emerging markets and direct real estate.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's a fickle game, though.</seg>
<seg id="11">Institutions have no qualms about shifting their money around as opportunities arise, and that is spurring volume movements in some stocks as funds come in and out of the share register.</seg>
<seg id="12">We've heard for some time now that the US recovery is under way and that investors should be looking to park some capital into US equities.</seg>
<seg id="13">If you were holding back, fearful that the US recovery was a false dawn, you may well have missed your chance to get in early.</seg>
<seg id="14">Indeed, right now institutional investors are reducing exposure to US equities and bonds while increasing exposure to Europe, emerging markets and direct real estate.</seg>
<seg id="15">A report recently released by AMP Capital shows that institutional investors have been fine-tuning their investing approach by complementing yield holdings with growth assets, with 77 per cent confirming they now favour capital growth over yield assets.</seg>
<seg id="16">Institutional investors are reacting to the prospect of the US Federal Reserve tapering its stimulus program and higher interest rates in the US and Europe by continuing to shift assets out of public markets and into alternatives, according to the AMP Capital Institutional Investor Research Report.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the equity space, Europe has become the focus as big investors look to take advantage of a recovery in that region.</seg>
<seg id="18">While there has been a shift towards growth, however, yield still has a part to play although in new forms.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The survey has found investors are favouring investments that offer value, potential for capital growth and predictable, consistent yields as global economies continue to improve," AMP Capital chief executive international and head of global clients Anthony Fasso says.</seg>
<seg id="20">As such, they are allocating more to alternatives and, in particular, real assets.</seg>
<seg id="21">One appeal of real assets is their tangibility, which offers greater stability and insulation from the risk of public equity markets.</seg>
<seg id="22">Allocations to high-yield corporate bonds are expected to lift, while demand for real assets such as direct property, infrastructure and infrastructure debt is also on the rise, with the stable bond-like payment structure providing predictable and consistent returns across the mid to long term.</seg>
<seg id="23">In fact, the greatest demand from institutions is for direct real estate and US property market has seen heavy action in recent times as prices recover.</seg>
<seg id="24">This interest in real assets is certainly something Australian retail investors can identify with.</seg>
<seg id="25">Indeed, it seems some Australian retail investors may be ahead of our financial institutions, with the early moves of private investors into property in recent months signalled by the lift in investor loans at the major banks.</seg>
<seg id="26">As Credit Suisse's recent 2013 wealth report highlighted, Australians have much more of their wealth in non-financial assets - that is, property - than the global average.</seg>
<seg id="27">Australian investors looking to join the quest for growth will probably be considering investing in overseas markets.</seg>
<seg id="28">But timing is everything.</seg>
<seg id="29">David McDonald, head of research at Credit Suisse Australia, advises caution in the short term because of events in the US and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="30">"The last 12 months were very good for returns, particularly for equities globally as well as in Australia, and we would expect things to be a bit more modest going forward," he says.</seg>
<seg id="31">There are a few issues out there in the short term in the US, and even in Europe and elsewhere, and when markets have had a big rise like that they can react sometimes to those wobbles a bit more.</seg>
<seg id="32">But McDonald suggests such caution in relation to offshore markets should just be short term.</seg>
<seg id="33">Over the very long term we're still positive on equities and other growth assets like real estate.</seg>
<seg id="34">Looking into next year, we still see the world recovering quite well.</seg>
<seg id="35">It seems that Europe's starting to pick up, China seems to be stable, so we think the opportunities down the track are quite positive.</seg>
<seg id="36">McDonald points to emerging markets as an investment opportunity, from a capital appreciation perspective and as a currency play.</seg>
<seg id="37">If you look at the projections, focusing on growth, Asia ex-Japan is likely to grow strongly and Asia including Japan will overtake America as the wealthiest region by 2018.</seg>
<seg id="38">Obviously that has some investment implications in terms of investment opportunities and exposure to that growth.</seg>

<seg id="1">NSW and Qld Cup winners to face off</seg>
<seg id="2">League NewsBreaking News SportNationalSport</seg>
<seg id="3">November 1, 2013 - 6:26PM</seg>
<seg id="4">The NRL has announced plans for the winners of the NSW and Queensland Cup competitions to face off on grand final day next year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Chief operating officer Jim Doyle says there is huge desire within the game for more focus on the second-tier competitions.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We are looking to build greater connections between NRL clubs and those in both the NSW and Queensland," Doyle said on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Seeing the winners of the two competitions playing on grand final day, for instance, is a way of underlining the links with the grassroots as well as a celebration of local heroes.</seg>
<seg id="8">""The Holden Cup is certainly going to remain a pivotal pathway in our game but more and more people will recognise the extent to which the State Leagues are the immediate springboard into the NRL.""</seg>
<seg id="9">Doyle says he hopes to complete the new salary cap review early next month and to present it club chief executives' approval at a December 4-5 meeting.</seg>
<seg id="10">The review process has already included extensive consultation with clubs, sponsors, player managers and media representatives.</seg>
<seg id="11">""We are still in the process of collecting and analysing all of the ideas out there," Doyle said."</seg>
<seg id="12">""By the time we next meet with the CEOs, we will be looking for their input on the suggestions that we most want to see considered.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much of what we are talking about is going to affect the 2015 season and beyond but if there are short-term issues that don't impact on the financial planning already in place at clubs then we will look at those.</seg>
<seg id="14">The 2014 season draw is expected to be finalised later this month and will again provide a fixed schedule for the first 20 rounds.</seg>
<seg id="15">"At this stage, no matches are locked in but we do have all of the information we need from clubs and broadcasters and the process is well and truly underway," said NRL head of football Todd Greenberg.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scientists have shed more light on how the movements of a dog's tail are linked to its mood.</seg>
<seg id="2">Earlier research had revealed that happy dogs wag their tails more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs have a left-dominated swish.</seg>
<seg id="3">But now scientists say that fellow canines can spot and respond to these subtle tail differences.</seg>
<seg id="4">Prof Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist from the University of Trento, said: "It is very well known in humans that the left and right side of the brain are differently involved in stimuli that invokes positive or negative emotions."</seg>
<seg id="5">Here we attempted to look at it in other species.</seg>
<seg id="6">He added that just as in humans, for dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for left-handed movement and vice versa, and the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.</seg>
<seg id="7">To find out more about how dogs react to the lop-sided tail wags of other dogs, the researchers monitored the animals as they watched films of other dogs.</seg>
<seg id="8">They measured the pets' heart rates and analysed their behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="9">It will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way, sometimes the other</seg>
<seg id="10">Prof Vallortigara said: "We presented dogs with movies of dogs - either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to get rid of any other confounding issues, and we could doctor the movement of the tail and present the tail more to the left or right."</seg>
<seg id="11">When the animals saw an otherwise expressionless dog move its tail to the right (from the tail-wagging dog's point of view), they stayed perfectly relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="12">But when they spotted a tail veer predominantly to the left (again from the tail-swishing dog's point of view), their heart rates picked up and they looked anxious.</seg>
<seg id="13">Prof Vallortigara said he didn't think that the dogs were intentionally communicating with each other through these movements.</seg>
<seg id="14">Instead, he believes that they dogs have learned from experience what moves they should and shouldn't feel worried about.</seg>
<seg id="15">He said: "If you have several meetings with other dogs, and frequently their tail wagging one way is associated with a more friendly behaviour, and the right side is producing a less friendly behaviour, you respond on the basis of that experience."</seg>
<seg id="16">The researchers say the findings could give owners, vets and trainers a better insight into their animal's emotions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dog behaviour expert John Bradshaw, a visiting fellow at the University of Bristol's school of veterinary science, said this was not the first study to examine whether left and right were important to canines.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog and to the right when looking at a happy dog.</seg>
<seg id="19">And in another research paper from the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "Dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when its 'tail' was made to wag left rather than right, rather than becoming anxious - the opposite way around to the Italian study."</seg>
<seg id="20">He said the differences could be because the dogs in the different studies were not fully interpreting the animals in the films or robo-dogs as canines.</seg>
<seg id="21">A study of how dogs responded to real dogs could help, he explained.</seg>
<seg id="22">"While there is considerable evidence from many different mammals that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes, much of the detail still has to be hammered out - and dogs are no exception," he said.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded, it will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way, sometimes the other.</seg>

<seg id="2">Dr. Georges Bwelle is bringing free health care to rural villages in Cameroon</seg>
<seg id="3">Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients</seg>
<seg id="4">There aren't many doctors in the west African country; just one for every 5,000 people</seg>
<seg id="5">Cast your vote here or through your mobile device</seg>
<seg id="6">Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.</seg>
<seg id="7">You can vote for him, or any of the other top 10 Heroes, to be CNN Hero of the Year.</seg>
<seg id="8">That person will receive $250,000 to continue their extraordinary work.</seg>
<seg id="9">For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his ill father slip in and out of consciousness, traveling to hospitals that weren't equipped to help him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Jamef Bwelle was injured in a 1981 car accident near Yaounde, Cameroon's capital.</seg>
<seg id="11">He suffered only a broken arm at first, but an infection developed and spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.</seg>
<seg id="12">"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," Georges Bwelle said.</seg>
<seg id="13">We would have taken him out of Cameroon if we had the money.</seg>
<seg id="14">Instead, Bwelle spent years escorting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, getting whatever treatment they could get.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It's not easy," Bwelle said.</seg>
<seg id="16">You can leave home at 5 a.m., running to the hospital to be the first, and you are not the first.</seg>
<seg id="17">There are a lot of patients.</seg>
<seg id="18">Some people can die because they are waiting.</seg>
<seg id="19">The situation hasn't changed much since Bwelle's father passed away in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.</seg>
<seg id="21">For comparison's sake, the ratio in the United States is one doctor for every 413 people.</seg>
<seg id="22">And even if they could see a physician, many Cameroonians couldn't afford it.</seg>
<seg id="23">Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country's health-care spending is private.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The only problem they have is poverty," Bwelle said.</seg>
<seg id="25">And with poverty, they cannot enjoy their life.</seg>
<seg id="26">Seeing his father and so many of his countrymen suffer, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.</seg>
<seg id="27">Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have performed 700 free surgeries in the past year.</seg>
<seg id="28">He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon in Yaounde's Central Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="29">And he started a nonprofit, ASCOVIME, that travels into rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="31">Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people jam into vans, tie medical supplies to the roofs and travel across rough terrain to visit villages in need.</seg>
<seg id="32">Their luck doesn't always hold out.</seg>
<seg id="33">They've had to push vehicles through rivers and mud more than once.</seg>
<seg id="34">But when they arrive, they receive a true heroes' welcome: a feast, singing and dancing, and the best accommodations the community can offer.</seg>
<seg id="35">In these villages, free medical care is truly a cause for celebration, and Bwelle -- with his big smile and boundless energy -- is more than happy to join in the fun.</seg>
<seg id="36">The next morning, the team begins meeting with hundreds of patients.</seg>
<seg id="37">"We are receiving 500 people in each trip," Bwelle said.</seg>
<seg id="38">They are coming from 60 kilometers around the village, and they're coming on foot.</seg>
<seg id="39">Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical care.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.</seg>
<seg id="41">Others might receive crutches, a pair of donated eyeglasses or free birth certificates -- documentation that's required for school but that many impoverished families simply can't afford.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the evenings, the team will do simple surgeries with local anesthesia.</seg>
<seg id="43">Operations are usually done in a schoolhouse, town hall or home; after the procedure, patients get up and walk to the recovery area to make way for the next person.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the group's generator lighting the operating room and sanitizing equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work into the early hours of Sunday morning.</seg>
<seg id="45">It's a backbreaking pace, but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"They are beating drums all night to keep us awake and continue our work," Bwelle said.</seg>
<seg id="47">On Sunday, the team heads back to the city, tired but proud of their work.</seg>
<seg id="48">The group -- a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students -- has performed 700 free surgeries in the past year, and they know that their help can make a world of difference to those they help.</seg>
<seg id="49">One man explained that the free hernia surgery he'd received will allow him to work again.</seg>
<seg id="50">"This will change my future with my family," the man said.</seg>
<seg id="51">In addition to holding these weekend clinics and working as a hospital surgeon, Bwelle also works nights at private medical clinics around Yaounde.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's this second job, he said, that funds about 60% of his nonprofit; the rest is covered by private donations.</seg>
<seg id="53">"I'm not sure when he sleeps," said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student from Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer with Bwelle's group.</seg>
<seg id="54">He is always either at the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="55">For medical and nursing students such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Bwelle on his missions, it's a hands-on opportunity they'd never get at home.</seg>
<seg id="56">"We've been able to scrub in on surgeries where we help blot blood away or hold tools for Dr. Bwelle," O'Malley said.</seg>
<seg id="57">That's not something you'd ever get to do in America as a second-year medical student.</seg>
<seg id="58">The student volunteers usually pay their own way to Cameroon, often arriving with donated medical supplies.</seg>
<seg id="59">But once they arrive in Yaounde, their board, transportation and instruction are covered by Bwelle.</seg>
<seg id="60">"He's a hero, without a doubt," O'Malley said.</seg>
<seg id="61">He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the Cameroon people is everlasting.</seg>
<seg id="62">For Bwelle, the near-constant workload isn't a hardship.</seg>
<seg id="63">Helping others live happier lives, fulfilling a promise he made to his father, is something that brings him great joy.</seg>
<seg id="64">"I am so happy when I am doing this work," Bwelle said.</seg>
<seg id="65">And I think about my father.</seg>
<seg id="66">I hope he sees what I am doing.</seg>
<seg id="67">To make people laugh, to reduce the pain, that's why I'm doing this.</seg>

<seg id="1">Transfer news: Wilfried Zaha set to begin talks with Cardiff City over loan move for the remainder of the season</seg>
<seg id="2">Cardiff City have spoken to Manchester United about the possibility of taking Wilfried Zaha on loan, according to reports.</seg>
<seg id="3">Zaha's manager at United, David Moyes, said earlier in the week that he is considering letting Zaha leave the club to gain first-team experience, as the England international has started only one competitive match for the Premier League champions - the 4-0 Capital One Cup victory over Norwich City on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 21-year-old former Crystal Palace player, who has two international caps, will be keen on getting playing time in a World Cup season, something that has not been afforded him at Old Trafford.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I just don't think we have had the right opportunity to get him on as much as would have liked," Moyes had said this week.</seg>
<seg id="6">We don't want to put him in too quickly.</seg>
<seg id="7">We want to make it the right time.</seg>
<seg id="8">I've said I would look at it in January as I wanted to have him here for six months to see how we work.</seg>
<seg id="9">I told him we would try to get him minutes but the competition in the wide areas we have with Nani, Antonio Valencia, Ashley Young, Adnan Januzaj and even Shinji Kagawa playing off the side means we are as strong there as anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's not that Wilf has done anything wrong, it's just that we have big competition and we have to try to make sure he gets some playing time.</seg>
<seg id="11">Unfortunately, we haven't done that with Wilf and, if it's still the case in January, we would look at it [sending him on loan].</seg>
<seg id="12">But he is very much in my plans and in my thoughts all the time.</seg>

<seg id="1">Key UK media hacking players had affair</seg>
<seg id="2">Former News of the World editors Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson were having an affair for much of the time they were allegedly involved in phone hacking at the Rupert Murdoch-owned tabloid, a court has heard.</seg>
<seg id="3">Prosecutor Andrew Edis said on Thursday that the affair, from 1998 to 2004, proved "they trusted each other" and supported charges that they conspired to hack phones to glean stories for the newspaper, which was renowned for its celebrity scoops until Murdoch closed it in disgrace two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">Brooks edited the News of the World from 2000 to 2003, when her deputy Coulson took over as editor.</seg>
<seg id="5">A close confidante of Murdoch's, Brooks went on to become chief executive of his British newspaper operations while Coulson became Prime Minister David Cameron's media chief.</seg>
<seg id="6">Both Brooks and Coulson deny hacking and related allegations in the high-profile trial at the Old Bailey in London, which involves six other defendants including Brooks' current husband.</seg>
<seg id="7">Her affair with Coulson was revealed in a love letter dated February 2004 that was found on her computer, the court heard.</seg>
<seg id="8">She apparently wrote it in response to Coulson's efforts to end the relationship.</seg>
<seg id="9">Both were married at the time - Brooks wed her first husband, actor Ross Kemp, in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="10">Coulson married in 2000 and has two children.</seg>
<seg id="11">Edis said he made no "moral judgement" about the defendants, who sat next to each other in the dock, Brooks' head bowed and Coulson looking towards the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="12">But the lawyer told the jury: "Mrs Brooks and Mr Coulson are charged with conspiracy, and when people are charged with conspiracy the first question a jury has to answer is, how well did they know each other?"</seg>
<seg id="13">""And the fact that they were in this relationship - which was a secret - means that they trusted each other quite a lot with at least that secret, and that's why we are telling you about it.""</seg>
<seg id="14">"In the letter, Brooks wrote: "The fact is you are my very best friend, I tell you everything, I confide in you, I seek your advice, I love you, care about you, worry about you, we laugh and cry together.</seg>
<seg id="15">In fact without our relationship in my life I am not sure I will cope.</seg>
<seg id="16">The prosecution alleges that Brooks, Coulson and ex-managing editor Stuart Kuttner must have known about widespread hacking at the News of the World between 2000 and 2006.</seg>
<seg id="17">Private investigator Glenn Mulcaire was paid STG100,000 ($A170,100) a year to work with an investigations team set up by Brooks, Edis said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Mulcaire has since admitted phone hacking, as has another member of the team, senior journalist Greg Miskiw.</seg>
<seg id="19">The prosecutor argued that Brooks, Coulson and Kuttner were trying to rein in the newspaper's budget and Mulcaire's contract would have stood out.</seg>
<seg id="20">The question is, didn't anybody ever ask, what are we paying this chap for?</seg>
<seg id="21">Edis said.</seg>
<seg id="22">Mulcaire admitted ahead of the trial to the worst case of phone hacking, which targeted schoolgirl Milly Dowler after she disappeared in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="23">The 13-year-old was later found murdered.</seg>
<seg id="24">Edis alleged that Coulson, Brooks and Kuttner "were criminally involved in the conspiracy which resulted from that phone hacking."</seg>
<seg id="25">It was public revulsion over the revelation that Milly Dowler was targeted which forced Murdoch to shut down the 168-year-old News of the World in July 2011.</seg>
<seg id="26">The court also heard that Brooks told Eimear Cook, ex-wife of golfer Colin Montgomerie, that phone hacking had been used for a story about former Beatle Paul McCartney.</seg>
<seg id="27">"She said all you needed was a person's mobile phone number and a factory pin and you could listen to their voicemail, and actually gave an example of a story involving Sir Paul McCartney and (his then-wife) Heather Mills," Edis said.</seg>
<seg id="28">The trial heard that the News of the World even hacked the phones of journalists at the rival Mail on Sunday as part of a "dog-eat-dog" competition for stories.</seg>
<seg id="29">"This was all about finding out how the competition were getting on with the story because, of course, you don't want to be scooped," Edis said.</seg>

<seg id="1">UNKNOWN assailants have thrown a homemade bomb at the home of the Tunisian consul in the Libyan capital, causing some damage but no casualties, officials and witnesses said.</seg>
<seg id="2">A diplomat said the consul was at home at the time of the attack.</seg>
<seg id="3">The blast chipped an outer wall of the residence, located in the Naufliyeen neighbourhood, and slightly damaged two nearby cars, the sources said.</seg>
<seg id="4">A witness said the attack occurred mid-afternoon on Tuesday (local time) when a white car sped past and someone hurled the bomb.</seg>
<seg id="5">The attack comes amid tensions between Tripoli and Tunis after a former premier of the late Libyan leader, Baghdadi al-Mahmudi was extradited to Libya on Sunday against the wishes of Tunisian President Moncef Marzouki.</seg>
<seg id="6">It also comes as Libyan medics and officials denied claims by Mr Mahmudi's lawyer that he was beaten and admitted to hospital after his extradition.</seg>
<seg id="7">Tunisia's post-revolution political alliance had been plunged into crisis over the affair.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr Marzouki is furious that Prime Minister Hamadi Jebali ordered Mr Mahmudi's transfer to Libya without his consent.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Marzouki had always opposed the extradition, arguing that Libya's new regime offered insufficient guarantees of a fair trial.</seg>
<seg id="10">But when Mr Jebali approved the move on Sunday, the president was in southern Tunisia for an official ceremony.</seg>

<seg id="1">Germany looks at keeping its Internet, e-mail traffic inside its borders</seg>
<seg id="2">BERLIN - The news that the National Security Agency has its eye on much of the world's electronic communications has shocked Germans who have memories of Nazi and Cold War-era spying.</seg>
<seg id="3">Now, an alliance of German phone and Internet companies claims it has a solution: German e-mail and Internet, transmitted within German borders.</seg>
<seg id="4">The proposals - one for Internet, one for e-mail - aim to boost the security of Germany's internal communications by preventing them from bouncing outside the country, which has far stricter privacy regulations than the United States.</seg>
<seg id="5">If a German customer wants to call up a German Web site, there is no reason the data must pass through a server in Virginia, exposing the information to potential surveillance along the way, the advocates say.</seg>
<seg id="6">The same goes for e-mails within Germany.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some security professionals say the efforts are little more than a marketing gimmick, since Germans would still want to surf American Web pages - Facebook, anyone? - and the Germany-only plans wouldn't make doing so any more secure.</seg>
<seg id="8">The NSA could also still theoretically access German data on German soil, as could Germany's own intelligence agencies.</seg>
<seg id="9">But for Germans who have been infuriated by a steady drip-drop of NSA allegations, including that Chancellor Angela Merkel's cellphone had been monitored for more than a decade, the initiatives may be attractive.</seg>
<seg id="10">And in the United States, technology industry advocates say they are bracing for tough competition from foreign companies that boast they are freer from U.S. intrusion and monitoring than American counterparts.</seg>
<seg id="11">"You have to make sure that your data is exclusively stored in Germany, on German ground," said Jan Oetjen, the chief executive of GMX, one of Germany's largest e-mail companies, which has teamed with the two other top German e-mail companies to offer a service called "E-Mail made in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="12">Germans tend to be very sensitive to the use of their data, I think due to German history.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Germans get taught at school to be cautious of a super-powerful state," he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Google's and Yahoo's main bridges to the Internet were cracked by the NSA, allowing full access to all the traffic passing through them, according to documents leaked to The Washington Post by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.</seg>
<seg id="15">And, also based on Snowden documents, the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel reported this week that spying was being conducted from the U.S. Embassy in Berlin, just steps from the Brandenburg Gate.</seg>
<seg id="16">The efforts to nationalize Internet traffic go beyond Germany.</seg>
<seg id="17">In Brazil, where President Dilma Rousseff was also allegedly monitored by the NSA, the government has pushed to require U.S. companies to store data about Brazilian customers inside Brazil.</seg>
<seg id="18">European Union leaders have advocated that their 28 nations develop "cloud" data storage that is independent from the United States.</seg>
<seg id="19">The accusation last week that the NSA had monitored Merkel's cellphone was for some Germans the final blow to an already strained alliance.</seg>
<seg id="20">Both U.S. and German officials have said privately that relations as a result may be the worst they have been in a decade, when then-Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder was a firm opponent of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.</seg>

<seg id="1">Egypt: Protests, heavy security planned for trial of ousted President Mohammed Morsi</seg>
<seg id="2">CAIRO Some 20,000 police officers and soldiers will guard the upcoming trial of Egypt's toppled president, an official said Thursday, as Islamist opponents plan massive protests that may spark more turmoil in the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">An Interior Ministry official warned that any protesters attempting to break into the courtroom where ousted President Mohammed Morsi will be tried will be met "decisively with force."</seg>
<seg id="4">The stark warning came as a Muslim Brotherhood-led coalition called Thursday for mass demonstrations across the country starting Friday until Nov.</seg>
<seg id="5">4, set as opening day of Morsi's trial.</seg>
<seg id="6">Morsi, a Brotherhood leader, faces charges of inciting murder and violence in connection to deadly clashes presidential palace in December.</seg>
<seg id="7">He's been held at an undisclosed location since the military toppled him in a popularly supported July 3 coup.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is not yet clear if the 62-year-old Morsi will appear in court, though the Interior Ministry official said that the ousted president will be flown by helicopter to the Torah prison complex.</seg>
<seg id="9">The trial will be held inside a police institute near the prison in southern Cairo, where most of the group's arrested leaders are held, the official said.</seg>
<seg id="10">It has not been announced yet whether Morsi will return to the undisclosed location or join other detained Brotherhood members in Tora prison after the hearing.</seg>
<seg id="11">Another security official said authorities favor holding him away from Tora to avoid the prison becoming a focal point for protesters, though civilian authorities likely will take responsibility for him from the start of the hearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">The officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they weren't authorized to speak publicly about security arrangements for Morsi's trial.</seg>
<seg id="13">Islamic militants step up attacks on Christians in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="14">Meanwhile, CBS News correspondent Clarissa Ward reports that there has been a wave of attacks against Egypt's Christian minority, which makes up about 10 percent of the country's population.</seg>
<seg id="15">Christians say they are being targeted by hardliners in the Muslim Brotherhood after they backed the military's crackdown on the Islamic group.</seg>
<seg id="16">Some fear the Morsi trial will mark a new cycle of turmoil in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="17">In a statement, the Brotherhood-led coalition described the trial as "illusionary" and said it would hold authorities responsible for any "harm" that comes to Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We have seen in the era of the coup those committing the crime are the ones who are presenting President Mohammed Morsi to be tried," the statement read.</seg>
<seg id="19">Morsi's trial is part of efforts by the military-backed interim government to break the Brotherhood.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nearly 2,000 Brotherhood members have been arrested since the coup, while top leaders face criminal charges.</seg>
<seg id="21">Meanwhile, authorities are pushing to quickly amend the country's constitution and hold parliamentary and presidential elections by early next year to cement their legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id="22">Egyptians already have seen former President Hosni Mubarak - overthrown in popular uprising in 2011 - on trial.</seg>
<seg id="23">The security crackdown on the Brotherhood saw security forces violently clear protest camps in Cairo, leaving hundreds dead and sparking weeks of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="24">Many fear that the violence will start again as Morsi goes on trial, especially with the heavy security cordon planned and the possibility of protesters clashing with police.</seg>
<seg id="25">Security forces arrested 20 women after clashes Thursday in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria, authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Interior Ministry official said that security forces will be deployed on the streets around the prison starting Saturday, two days before the trial.</seg>
<seg id="27">He said they will close all entrances to trial site, while "combat teams" will be on rooftops surrounding Torah prison "to abort any plots by the Muslim Brotherhood to foil the trial."</seg>
<seg id="28">During Egypt's 18-day uprising in 2011, protesters accused police of shooting at them from rooftops.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Any attempt to smuggle prisoners, storm the courtroom or get near Torah prisons ... will be dealt with decisively, with force and by law," he said.</seg>
<seg id="30">Meanwhile Thursday, Egypt's state MENA news agency said soldiers arrested Abdel-Fatah Hassan Salem, the leader of Takfir and Hijra, one of the militant groups active in the Sinai Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="31">He is seen as a mastermind of some recent attacks targeting security forces in the areas.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mongol bikies 'ready to kill police'</seg>
<seg id="2">Mongol bikies are arming themselves and are ready to kill police, Queensland officers are being warned.</seg>
<seg id="3">Source: Supplied</seg>
<seg id="4">POLICE in Queensland are being warned about their security following threats that Mongol bikies are ready to kill to avoid arrest under new anti-gang laws.</seg>
<seg id="5">Officers have been told of the threat in a confidential memo that's been published in the media.</seg>
<seg id="6">It says information dated Monday, October 28 "indicates the Mongols criminal motorcycle gang have discussed the possibility of killing any police officer who attempt (sic) to arrest them for a serious offence."</seg>
<seg id="7">Information suggests the Mongols are currently seeking multiple automatic firearms whilst a member of the Black Uhlans CMG was previously confirmed to have sought to obtain automatic firearms (M16 and AK47) on behalf of the Mongols and Finks CMG.</seg>
<seg id="8">This anticipation of escalating violence is said to be a result of legislation mandating automatic custodial sentences of up to 15 years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Mongols are said to believe killing a police officer to evade arrest is worth the risk to escape the lengthy custodial sentence.</seg>
<seg id="10">The memo adds that so far the threats are non-specific in nature, and are not targeted at specific members of the police service.</seg>
<seg id="11">Police have issued a formal statement repeating the threats are not specific, and saying police had been warned about personal security issues.</seg>
<seg id="12">For operational reasons it would be inappropriate to comment further.</seg>
<seg id="13">Under the new laws, bikies convicted of serious crimes face hefty additional jail terms simply for being members of declared criminal gangs.</seg>
<seg id="14">The government has also announced plans for a bikies only jail, and says jailed members will be forced to wear pink prison garb as they spend up to 23 hours a day in solitary confinement.</seg>
<seg id="15">Police Minister Jack Dempsey says the safety of officers is the government's top priority.</seg>
<seg id="16">"All threats will be fully investigated by police and the proper precautions taken," he said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="17">The government has assured the police commissioner that we will provide the QPS with whatever resources the commissioner requires to remove these criminal gangs and thugs from Queensland.</seg>
<seg id="18">Commissioner Ian Stewart has said a review is underway to determine if police should be given more powerful guns and body armour in response to the bikie gang threat.</seg>

<seg id="1">Google, Samsung, Huawei sued over Nortel patents</seg>
<seg id="2">The group that owns thousands of former Nortel patents filed a barrage of patent lawsuits on Thursday against cell phone manufacturers including Google, the company it outbid in the Nortel bankruptcy auction.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in U.S. District Court in Texas.</seg>
<seg id="4">Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.</seg>
<seg id="5">Google is accused of infringing seven patents.</seg>
<seg id="6">The patents cover technology that helps match Internet search terms with relevant advertising, the lawsuit said, which is the core of Google's search business.</seg>
<seg id="7">Representatives for Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not immediately be reached.</seg>
<seg id="8">Samsung, Huawei and HTC all manufacture phones that operate on Google's Android operating system, which competes fiercely with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2011 Google placed an initial $900 million bid for Nortel's patents.</seg>
<seg id="10">Google increased its bid several times, ultimately offering as much as $4.4 billion.</seg>
<seg id="11">After losing out to Rockstar on the Nortel patents, Google went on to acquire Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal driven partly by Motorola's library of patents.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Despite losing in its attempt to acquire the patents-in-suit at auction, Google has infringed and continues to infringe," the lawsuit said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rockstar is seeking increased damages against Google, as it claims Google's patent infringement is willful, according to the complaint.</seg>

<seg id="3">Harvey, the club's games record-holder (383), could step into the job immediately after impressive coaching stints at Carlton, St Kilda and Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the end of last season Harvey was promoted to Collingwood's senior assistants role after taking charge of the club's star-studded midfield.</seg>

<seg id="1">U.K. prosecutor: Tabloid execs in phone hacking case had affair</seg>
<seg id="2">LONDON In a blockbuster declaration at Britain's phone hacking trial, a prosecutor said two of Rupert Murdoch's former senior tabloid executives - Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson, later a top aide to Prime Minister David Cameron - had an affair lasting at least six years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Prosecutor Andrew Edis made the disclosure Thursday during Coulson's and Brooks' trial on phone hacking and other charges, the first major criminal case to go to court in the hacking saga that has shaken Britain's political, judicial and media elite.</seg>
<seg id="4">Brooks, Coulson and six other people are now on trial, including Brooks' current husband Charles.</seg>
<seg id="5">All deny the various charges against them, which range from phone hacking to bribing officials for scoops to obstructing police investigations.</seg>
<seg id="6">Edis said the relationship between Brooks and Coulson was relevant to the hacking case because it showed they trusted one another and shared intimate information.</seg>
<seg id="7">Rebekah Brooks charges could mean life in prison</seg>
<seg id="8">"Throughout the relevant period, what Mr. Coulson knew Mrs. Brooks knew, and what Mrs. Brooks knew Mr. Coulson knew," Edis said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Edis said the affair began in 1998 and lasted about six years.</seg>
<seg id="10">If his timeline is correct, the affair ended before Coulson became Cameron's top communications director, which began after Cameron's election in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="11">Coulson started working for Cameron in 2007, when Cameron became leader of Britain's Conservative opposition party.</seg>
<seg id="12">The affair covered the period when Brooks was the top editor of Murdoch's News of the World tabloid and Coulson was her deputy.</seg>
<seg id="13">Brooks edited the paper from 2000 to 2003, then went on to edit its sister paper, The Sun, and later became the chief executive of Murdoch's British newspaper division.</seg>
<seg id="14">Coulson edited the News of the World from 2003 to 2007.</seg>
<seg id="15">The affair covered the crucial period in 2002 when the News of the World hacked the phone of murdered teenager Milly Dowler.</seg>
<seg id="16">Brooks has long denied knowing about that hacking.</seg>
<seg id="17">When the Dowler hacking case became public in 2011, the outrage in Britain was so great that Murdoch shut down the 168-year-old paper.</seg>
<seg id="18">Edis said a February 2004 letter from Brooks showed there was "absolute confidence between the two of them in relation to all the problems at their work."</seg>
<seg id="19">He said the letter appeared to have been written by Brooks in response to Coulson's attempt to end the relationship.</seg>
<seg id="20">You are my very best friend.</seg>
<seg id="21">I tell you everything.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I confide in you, I seek your advice," Brooks wrote, according to Edis.</seg>
<seg id="23">Without our relationship in my life I am really not sure I will cope.</seg>
<seg id="24">Rebekah Brooks apologizes</seg>
<seg id="25">Edis said the affair was uncovered when police searched a computer found at Brooks' home in 2011 as part of the hacking investigation.</seg>
<seg id="26">It's not clear whether the letter was ever sent.</seg>
<seg id="27">Brooks married soap-opera star Ross Kemp in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="28">They later divorced and she married horse trainer Charles Brooks in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="29">In his opening arguments Thursday, Edis said News of the World journalists, with consent from the tabloid's top editors, colluded to hack the phones of politicians, royalty, celebrities and even rival reporters in a "frenzy" to get scoops.</seg>
<seg id="30">He said the "dog-eat-dog" environment led to routine lawbreaking that was sanctioned by those in charge of the Murdoch-owned tabloid: editors Rebekah Brooks and Coulson.</seg>
<seg id="31">Jurors were shown email exchanges involving private investigator Glenn Mulcaire and News of the World news editor Ian Edmondson - one of the defendants - detailing the 2006 hacking of former government minister Tessa Jowell, royal family member Frederick Windsor and one-time Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, who was the subject of a major kiss-and-tell story from a mistress.</seg>
<seg id="32">Mulcaire also hacked the phones of two journalists at the rival Mail on Sunday tabloid who were working on their own story about the Prescott affair, the prosecutor said.</seg>
<seg id="33">"In the frenzy to get the huge story ... that's what you do," Edis said.</seg>
<seg id="34">Edis also played a recording of Mulcaire "blagging" - seeking information about a voicemail password from a service provider using a false name.</seg>
<seg id="35">He said Mulcaire - an "accomplished" blagger and hacker - made the recording himself, and also recorded some of the voicemails he hacked.</seg>
<seg id="36">The prosecutor said the emails, the recordings and pages from Mulcaire's notebooks provided "very clear evidence" of hacking so widespread that senior editors must have known about it.</seg>
<seg id="37">Edis said Mulcaire was paid almost 100,000 pounds a year under a contract that started in 2001 and ended when he was arrested in 2006 for hacking the phones of royal aides.</seg>
<seg id="38">He and the tabloid's royal editor Clive Goodman were briefly jailed and for years, Murdoch's media company maintained that hacking had been limited only to that pair.</seg>
<seg id="39">That claim was demolished when the Dowler case became public in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="40">Murdoch's company has since paid millions in compensation to scores of people whose phones were hacked.</seg>
<seg id="41">Rebekah Brooks, Coulson, Edmondson and former managing editor Stuart Kuttner all deny charges of phone hacking.</seg>
<seg id="42">The trial is expected to last roughly six months.</seg>
<seg id="43">Mulcaire has pleaded guilty, along with three former News of the World news editors.</seg>
<seg id="44">15 Photos</seg>
<seg id="45">UK hacking scandal's famous targets</seg>
<seg id="46">Edis said there are few records of what Mulcaire was paid to do by the newspaper, but that senior editors must have known of his illicit activity.</seg>
<seg id="47">"The question is, did nobody ever ask, 'What are we paying this chap for?'" he said.</seg>
<seg id="48">Somebody must have decided that what he was doing was worth an awful lot of money.</seg>
<seg id="49">Who was that?</seg>
<seg id="50">He said Rebekah Brooks, who edited the News of the World when Mulcaire was put on retainer "was actively involved in financial management" and sent editors stern emails about keeping costs down.</seg>
<seg id="51">Under Coulson, who succeeded her as editor, Mulcaire's fee was increased to 2,019 pounds a week.</seg>
<seg id="52">Edis said there was no evidence that Mulcaire's fees were ever questioned.</seg>
<seg id="53">"You would question it - unless you knew all about it," Edis said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Review: Naomi Watts is extraordinary in the flawed 'Diana'</seg>
<seg id="2">While Diana, Princess of Wales, was living life as the World's Most Famous Woman, happiness was an elusive pursuit: a nagging struggle between a thirst for privacy and a need for affirming public recognition.</seg>
<seg id="3">That the new film "Diana," based on Kate Snell's book about Diana's two-year secret romance with heart surgeon Hasnat Khan, has met with contemptuous reception in Britain only shows that the late royal belongs more to the people she touched and inspired than any one film could hope to dramatize.</seg>
<seg id="4">While "Diana" is hardly a fully effective film, it admirably tries to understand a lonely public figure made briefly, energetically whole through a nourished intimacy.</seg>
<seg id="5">In that context, German director Oliver Hirschbiegel - whose "Downfall" benefited from Bruno Ganz's last-days portraiture of Hitler - is fortunate that Naomi Watts is under that frosted blond helmet and working those searching, melancholy eyes.</seg>
<seg id="6">PHOTOS: Celebrities by The Times</seg>
<seg id="7">When Hirschbiegel drops his consciously arty touches and focuses on Watts, the actress doesn't take long to establish Diana's tightening solitude - the public smile for adoring throngs and car-banging paparazzi that settles into a grim, blank stare as her driver speeds away.</seg>
<seg id="8">And in the bloom of flirtation and desire after meeting the kind-eyed, coolly arrogant but playful Khan, rendered sharply by Naveen Andrews, Watts becomes a sensitively awkward romantic comedy heroine (even if the direction in these scenes is simply awkward).</seg>
<seg id="9">When she sports a brunet wig or rides in car trunks to elude the press, she's even a giddy spy in the house of love.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then when the going gets tough - the prideful, private Khan bristling at her spotlighted existence, while she struggles to find a workable middle ground - Watts segues perfectly into the exquisitely agonized Diana, so close to emotional fulfillment yet so despairingly far.</seg>
<seg id="11">Where the glass slipper strains to fit in "Diana" comes from the stuff that sinks a lot of biopics: clichéd dialogue (in this case, from Stephen Jeffreys) and clunky adherence to a timeline.</seg>
<seg id="12">But while "Diana" may not be the fleet-of-foot and smartly touching exploration of a beleaguered leader that was "The Queen," it's also not the dippy historical vaudeville that was "The Iron Lady."</seg>
<seg id="13">Flawed yet intimate, "Diana" respects its subject's hopes, strengths, weaknesses and legacy and, in the extraordinary Watts, boasts a formidably empathetic advocate.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hibernian manager Pat Fenlon given support by Craig Levein</seg>
<seg id="2">The Irishman had failed to negotiate a safe passage past what his Hearts counterpart, Gary Locke, had described as "a youth team."</seg>
<seg id="3">A solitary goal from Ryan Stevenson was enough to take the Premiership's bottom club, whose outfield players had an average age of 21, into Thursday's draw for the semi-finals of the League Cup, where they were paired with Inverness Caledonian Thistle.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, even though he has presided over only four home wins in 2013, former Hearts, Dundee United and Scotland manager Craig Levein, who made yesterday's draw at Hampden, argues that Hibs should persevere with Fenlon.</seg>
<seg id="5">Hibs are in a reasonable position just now.</seg>
<seg id="6">I think they will be a top-six team.</seg>
<seg id="7">I know you could argue that is expected of them but they haven't always been in the top six.</seg>
<seg id="8">Also, with all due respect, in Scotland we are not getting the best managers in Britain because everything is in tiers and the idea is that you keep moving up.</seg>
<seg id="9">Financially, [in Scotland] they are not the best jobs.</seg>
<seg id="10">Plus it's not in England, where you are the centre of attention, so I believe that if you make the choice to bring a manager in you should give him time to get things right.</seg>
<seg id="11">Levein also revealed that he had provided Fenlon with a glowing reference before chief executive Rod Petrie chose to lure him away from his post with Bohemians in Dublin.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Someone at Hibs phoned me and asked about him," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Â "I'd met Pat a few times through a friend of mine in Ireland."</seg>
<seg id="14">Pat did a great job there and I certainly recommended him as a character, although I hadn't worked with him.</seg>
<seg id="15">I think he is a decent person.</seg>
<seg id="16">He is certainly a really hard working guy.</seg>
<seg id="17">As I say, he had that little period where things were not working out.</seg>
<seg id="18">He overcame that.</seg>
<seg id="19">If that defeat on Tuesday had not been against Hearts, it wouldn't have been quite as sore.</seg>
<seg id="20">The fact that Hearts were weakened by a lot of other things probably made Hibs the strongest favourites they have been for a while.</seg>
<seg id="21">That builds the expectation levels for their fans but he is a strong character and he'll battle through it.</seg>

<seg id="14">"Once breasts begin to develop, it takes at least two to three years before menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem."</seg>
<seg id="15">Time is the most accurate test of how puberty is going to progress.</seg>
<seg id="16">There is debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered "precocious" when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth spurt before age 8.</seg>
<seg id="17">In most cases, the process will slow down or stall -- something a pediatrician can monitor closely.</seg>
<seg id="18">A more rapid progression may warrant tests by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.</seg>
<seg id="19">There are treatments to delay early menses and ward off another consequence: premature aging of the bones that ultimately can lead to stunted growth and being short as an adult.</seg>
<seg id="20">Recommendations for drug or hormone therapy are based on the child's age, rate of development, growth rate and emotional maturity.</seg>
<seg id="21">Psychosocial aspects are important, too.</seg>
<seg id="22">Kaplowitz is cautious with medication but acknowledges, "suppressing puberty may alleviate behavioral issues and girls' feelings of being different from peers."</seg>
<seg id="23">The other big issue is understandable: Parents simply don't want their very young daughters having periods.</seg>
<seg id="24">"They worry about the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle hygiene," said Kaplowitz.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It was a shock," recalls one woman whose daughter started her period at 10.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though there were signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.</seg>
<seg id="27">She came home from school scared and upset to be the first among her friends.</seg>
<seg id="28">There are lots of well-publicized theories about the causes of precocious puberty.</seg>
<seg id="29">Yet, there's no consistent body of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are to blame.</seg>
<seg id="30">Boys - like girls - are hitting puberty earlier.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kaplowitz contends the premise that holds the most weight is the epidemic of obesity.</seg>
<seg id="32">He helped conduct a 2001 study of 6- to 9-year-old girls that links body fat to the timing of puberty.</seg>
<seg id="33">Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.</seg>
<seg id="34">In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.</seg>
<seg id="35">There are varying explanations.</seg>
<seg id="36">Globally, patterns of early puberty appear to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.</seg>
<seg id="37">Another conundrum: Although boys are getting facial and pubic hair at younger ages, the trend toward full-blown early puberty is not as pronounced as it is with girls.</seg>
<seg id="38">Other doctors attending the AAP conference reinforced the complexities of the topic.</seg>
<seg id="39">The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even in infants and toddlers.</seg>
<seg id="40">"We need to be careful about how we identify the true onset of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.</seg>
<seg id="41">Parents should not hesitate to get guidance from their pediatrician about how to talk with their child.</seg>
<seg id="42">"It may mean having a sooner-than-expected conversation," Kaplowitz advised.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you remain calm, your child usually will respond well.</seg>
<seg id="44">Girls who blossom early need reassurance that, even when it happens ahead of schedule, the process is a normal part of life.</seg>

<seg id="1">Obama Ends Spying on IMF and World Bank</seg>
<seg id="2">Barack Obama has ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to stop tapping the lines of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, said an American official on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">This decision is part of attempts by the White House to resume control of the NSA phone-tapping affair following revelations by the former analyst, Edward Snowden, who has taken refuge in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is the first time that surveillance of the IMF and World Bank by the intelligence agency has been mentioned since the start of the scandal.</seg>
<seg id="5">When asked about this, an official of the American administration replied: "The United States is not conducting electronic surveillance aimed at offices of the World Bank and IMF in Washington."</seg>
<seg id="6">Talking under the cloak of anonymity, the official did not specify whether such surveillance had taken place in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">Another official indicated that Barack Obama had given the order to stop these practices during recent weeks.</seg>
<seg id="8">The instruction was given at almost the same time as that putting an end to phone-tapping of the UN headquarters in New York.</seg>
<seg id="9">In this regard, the Senate Intelligence Committee approved strengthening of the controls on government surveillance programmes on Thursday, but still authorised them to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="10">The committee introduced new restrictions on the data that the intelligence services were authorised to collect and imposed a limit of five years on the length of time they could hold such data.</seg>

<seg id="1">NSA Affair Emphasizes Complete Lack of Debate on Intelligence</seg>
<seg id="2">Why the contradictory attitude of the French government? On the one hand, it publicly takes offence and summons the Ambassador of the United States on October 21 and, on the other, it forbids the Bolivian president's plane to enter its air space on the basis of a rumor that Edward Snowden was on board?</seg>
<seg id="3">In my opinion, there are two levels of response from the French government.</seg>
<seg id="4">When François Hollande telephones Barack Obama, or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summons the Ambassador of the United States, they are responding to a real discovery, that of the scale of America's surveillance of communications within France generally.</seg>
<seg id="5">And is it not surprising to read in the pages of Le Monde, on the one hand, a reproduction of diplomatic correspondence with the US and, on the other, condemnation of the NSA's spying on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the Quai d'Orsay, within a matter of weeks?</seg>
<seg id="6">Is there not an element of hypocrisy on your part?</seg>
<seg id="7">The journalistic method is not to adopt a moral position, but to investigate the significance and relevance of information and enable every citizen to form an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="8">When WikiLeaks reveals the American administration's monitoring of political and other matters somewhere in the world, we consider this to be significant enlightenment with regard to the American government.</seg>
<seg id="9">In describing the American methods of data interception in relation to the French diplomatic representation in the United States, we do not aim at expressing indignation about this practice, but rather at describing the world as it is.</seg>
<seg id="10">Has France benefited from the intelligence supplied by the NSA concerning terrorist operations against our interests?</seg>
<seg id="11">Can we do without collaboration with the Americans?</seg>
<seg id="12">The setting up of high-performance interception technology over practically the past ten years by the United States - and by France - has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, in this regard, France and the United States in particular have implemented procedures, sometimes described as essential, for cooperating and exchanging information on an almost daily basis.</seg>
<seg id="14">For example, France was informed of the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas of Miranshah through the NSA's resources.</seg>
<seg id="15">Also France may, for example, have to transmit entire blocks of data on the Sahel region to the Americans and, in return - as already briefly mentioned - the Americans may provide information to the French about other parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hence the question at the heart of the NSA affair is not so much the capacity or the right of a country to use interception tools, as the issue of the complete lack of prior debate - especially within parliaments - on the justification of such systems, the extent to which they should be used and, ultimately, the issue of the infringement of freedoms.</seg>
<seg id="17">What risk does the United States actually run? Ruining its image?</seg>
<seg id="18">However much we denounce the US, I see no way in which it can be punished.</seg>
<seg id="19">The risk run by the Americans could be twofold.</seg>
<seg id="20">The first is when their allies - as has been the case recently - learn that their governments have been spied on, sometimes at the highest level.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is the case in Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States are strained.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another effect could be more commercial: in the light of the revelations, more and more European and South American countries are balking at the idea of entrusting their confidential data to American providers that are subject to American law and hence to the grips of the NSA.</seg>
<seg id="23">Finally, the widespread exercise in revelations conducted by the media across the world, which is contributing to the establishment of a debate on surveillance practices by intelligence services that have been almost invisible until now, could force legislators - including those of America - to reconsider the powers they have granted their intelligence agencies.</seg>

<seg id="1">Cocaine-addict lawyer who tipped off Mr Big about police investigation is jailed</seg>
<seg id="2">Basharat Ditta, 42, would feed information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough</seg>
<seg id="3">The solicitor feared his secret drug addiction would be exposed</seg>
<seg id="4">Was given a three-year prison sentence at Liverpool Crown Court</seg>
<seg id="5">A top defence lawyer who told a drugs Mr Big about a major police investigation, because he feared his secret drug addiction would be exposed, has been jailed for three years.</seg>
<seg id="6">Basharat Ditta, 42, would feed sensitive intelligence to crime lord Neil Scarbrough about inquiries into his drug trafficking activities after he became compromised by his cocaine habit.</seg>
<seg id="7">The solicitor, who was nicknamed "Bash" and hailed by criminals as a "top brief," was arrested at his home in 2011 following a police surveillance operation into Scarborough, who he had represented in a previous narcotics trial.</seg>
<seg id="8">Officers spotted Sarborough, 32, dropping off three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was out at a Law Society dinner with colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="9">Inquiries revealed Ditta was a "regular user" of the Class A drug after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on his credit cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Over an eight month period between January and August 2011 he sought to illicitly obtain information on the arrests of two men on behalf of Scarborough as well as one of his associates.</seg>
<seg id="11">All four suspects were being watched by police at the time as part of a major investigation into a heroin and cocaine racket operating across Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.</seg>
<seg id="12">They and 32 other men were later jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine worth £1.5million along with more than £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ditta, 42, fed information to criminals because of fears his cocaine addiction would be exposed</seg>
<seg id="14">Today at Liverpool Crown Court Ditta, who works at law firm Forbes Solicitors, based in Blackburn, was facing disgrace after being found guilty of two counts of perverting the course of justice following a three week trial at Liverpool Crown Court.</seg>
<seg id="15">He admitted cocaine possession at an earlier hearing.</seg>
<seg id="16">The lawyer's downfall came after police investigating Scarborough discovered he had been in regular phone contact with Ditta in February 2011.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two detectives trailed the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta's house in and was seen to place the drugs which had a purity of 60 per cent under the lawyer's bins in a black golf glove.</seg>
<seg id="18">Soon after the drop off, Scarborough was in regular phone contact with Ditta who had been out at the dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium, Ewood Park.</seg>
<seg id="19">The lawyer returned home to discover the drugs and there were nine communications between them.</seg>
<seg id="20">The court heard Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine after tests found traces of the Class A drug in his hair, wallet and on his credit cards</seg>
<seg id="21">Ditta was arrested later but denied using cocaine and and said he had been speaking to the suspected dealer because he was his client and argued their discussions were subject to "legal privilege."</seg>
<seg id="22">During his arrest Ditta picked up his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken fom him.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a police interview he said he ran an office at his home address as well as work place and clients would call at his house on legal business.</seg>
<seg id="24">But the court heard he would call major players in the drugs supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented, after key arrests to tell them what detectives knew about them.</seg>
<seg id="25">Prosecuting, Anne Whyte said: "If anyone should know not to the break the law, it is a criminal solicitor."</seg>
<seg id="26">Mr Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal solicitor, having become too involved with specific clients.</seg>
<seg id="27">The relationship we are talking about is not simply a drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing his own lawyer with drugs.</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of his communications will undoubtedly have been legitimate ones because he was their lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="29">But this went way beyond the ordinary confines of a lawyer-client relationship.</seg>
<seg id="30">He thwarted the police's investigation as much as possible to enable them to continue in their criminal activities.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr Ditta was not honouring his profession, but dishonouring it.</seg>
<seg id="32">He got too close to certain clients, in particular Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.</seg>
<seg id="33">Ditta denied wrongdoing and claimed: "If I was a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and I wanted to feed information to Mr Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, I would do it immediately."</seg>
<seg id="34">But after the hearing Supt Lee Halstead from Lancashire Police said: "Mr Ditta turned from criminal solicitor to a criminal himself the moment he started obtaining drugs from organised criminals."</seg>
<seg id="35">His addiction to cocaine left him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the motives of leading members of organised crime groups who tasked him to obtain valuable information regarding police investigations.</seg>
<seg id="36">Solicitors should uphold the highest standards of integrity and should instil trust and confidence in the public.</seg>
<seg id="37">Mr Ditta has betrayed this trust and attempted to hide behind the veneer of his profession.</seg>
<seg id="38">Lancashire's Serious and Organised Crime Unit led the investigation into Mr Ditta which has also seen him convicted of three counts of possession of cocaine and now perverting the course of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bringing criminals to justice.</seg>
<seg id="39">Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.</seg>
<seg id="40">We will find you and put you before the courts.</seg>
<seg id="41">Scarborough himself was jailed for 14 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.</seg>
<seg id="42">Thirty five other men involved in the racket were jailed for a total of 153 years for drugs offences.</seg>
<seg id="43">On his website Ditta gave a question and answer session about himself in which he says his fantasy job would be a lawyer representing clients on Death Row in America, his ultimate dinner guest as being Mohammed Ali and inequality as his motivation for work.</seg>

<seg id="2">AFL Draft hopeful Darcy Hourigan from South Adelaide.</seg>
<seg id="3">DARCY Hourigan has always been a strong kid.</seg>
<seg id="4">Growing up on a turkey and cattle farm just outside of Strathalbyn, the 2013 AFL draft hopeful quickly learnt what a hard day's work was.</seg>
<seg id="5">He also quickly developed a strong frame.</seg>
<seg id="6">"It was a good life growing up," he says</seg>
<seg id="7">I'd help the old man out with odd jobs and things.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was probably a different life to the average kid from the city.</seg>
<seg id="9">By 15, the key position player was the size of a man and he became South Adelaide's youngest-ever SANFL league debutant, in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="10">He has played a handful of league games since but it was at this season's national under-18 carnival when Hourigan proved is more than just a big kid.</seg>
<seg id="11">Now 18, he bagged 16 goals - more than any other player at the carnival - prompting some judges to declare him among the best power forwards in the draft pool behind likely No.</seg>
<seg id="12">1 pick Tom Boyd.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I was pretty rapt with how the carnival went," Hourigan says.</seg>
<seg id="14">It was nice to kick some goals and play pretty consistent footy which was my aim coming in.</seg>
<seg id="15">The landscaping employee showed he has a strong mark, and a clutch left foot kick, as evidenced by his crucial goal from tight in the pocket after the three-quarter-time siren against Vic Metro.</seg>
<seg id="16">But Hourigan also went a long way to disproving the major knock on his game by showing, that at 94kg, he is mobile enough to lead opponents up the ground.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The major focus this year for me was improving my endurance and my second efforts," he says.</seg>
<seg id="18">As a forward in AFL these days, you've got to be able to show that if you don't mark the ball you still have the ability to compete on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="19">At 192cm, the only question that remains on Hourigan is whether recruiters will see him as tall enough to hold down a key position in the AFL.</seg>
<seg id="20">One thing is for sure, Hourigan is doing all he can to show scouts he has plenty to offer at the next level.</seg>
<seg id="21">"My endurance, I can definitely still improve but I believe I can continue to do that within an AFL system," he says.</seg>
<seg id="22">Height: 192cm</seg>
<seg id="23">Weight: 94kg</seg>
<seg id="24">Club: South</seg>
<seg id="25">Position: key forward/defender</seg>
<seg id="26">Scouting report: A brute of lad, Hourigan can take a strong mark and has a penetrating left foot kick.</seg>
<seg id="27">At 192cm, the key will be whether recruiters see him as tall enough to play key position in the AFL</seg>

<seg id="9">Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said on Friday that he saw no reason for Moscow to cut gas supplies to Ukraine over an unpaid bill for now, playing down talk of an imminent "gas war" that might disrupt flows to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="10">In an interview with Reuters, he denied Russia's demands for payment had anything to do with opposition to Ukraine signing agreements with the European Union this month which would mark a historic shift away from former imperial master Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="11">But Medvedev said the "special relationship" between the two former Soviet republics would change if Ukraine moved closer to Europe and that Kiev should no longer come to Moscow seeking loans.</seg>
<seg id="12">IMF pressure</seg>
<seg id="13">The International Monetary Fund could help Ukraine, but only if the government raises domestic gas prices and reforms the economy, both unpopular steps which Kiev has previously rejected.</seg>
<seg id="14">IMF mission leader Nikolay Gueorguiev laid out the Fund's view at the end of a 12-day visit to Ukraine on Thursday, saying the country required a "set of comprehensive and credible reforms" to stabilise the economy and revive growth.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Ukraine's significant external financing needs remain a key vulnerability," Gueorguiev said in a statement, referring to foreign debt repayments looming for gas deliveries from Russia and for servicing loans and credits, including to the Fund itself.</seg>
<seg id="16">He zeroed in on the loss-making energy sector and called again for an end to the unprofitable practice of Soviet-era subsidies in which state run oil and gas company Naftogaz sells gas to households and other domestic consumers at prices way below the level at which it buys from Russia.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The large loss-making energy sector needs to be reformed," he said.</seg>

<seg id="2">One of the most sophisticated drug smuggling tunnels between the USA and Mexico has been found, complete with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems.</seg>
<seg id="3">US authorities described the four foot by three foot tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they have ever discovered.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tunnel, which zigzags the length of nearly six football pitches, links warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico and San Diego, USA.</seg>
<seg id="5">The area is filled with nondescript warehouses, making it easier to conceal trucks being loaded with drugs.</seg>
<seg id="6">The tunnel was shut down before any drugs made it through undetected, authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="7">Authorities seized eight-and-a-half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the tunnel's discovery, according to court records.</seg>
<seg id="8">Three men who authorities say worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to distribute.</seg>
<seg id="9">They face prison sentences between 10 years and life imprisonment if convicted.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers tap into vast underground drainage canals.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.</seg>

<seg id="3">Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for a carry-on bag and $2 for coffee or soda, although its announcement on Wednesday did say that passengers will get to keep the whole can.</seg>
<seg id="4">The new carry-on fee is for bags in the overhead bin, so small bags under the seat will still be free.</seg>
<seg id="5">Frontier said it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, $100 if travelers wait to pay until they're at the gate.</seg>
<seg id="6">Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is to get travelers to take care of the charge in advance.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We don't want to charge that," she said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Airlines began charging for the first and second checked bags in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="9">Passengers trying to avoid those fees have been stuffing as much as they can into carry-on baggage stashed in overhead bins, meaning those bins often run out of space.</seg>
<seg id="10">Fees are one way to get passengers to bring less on board.</seg>
<seg id="11">O'Malley said the new charge is not really about raising money.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's about Frontier's most loyal customers making it very clear that finding overhead bin space has become increasingly difficult.</seg>
<seg id="13">Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline's website won't have to pay.</seg>
<seg id="14">That means one passenger in line at a Frontier gate might get to bring a bag on for free, while the next person in line might owe $100 for a similar bag.</seg>
<seg id="15">O'Malley said Frontier's website and check-in procedures are being changed to make sure passengers know about the fee before they get to the gate.</seg>
<seg id="16">Frontier's new carry-on fee won't start until summer, though a date hasn't been set.</seg>
<seg id="17">Passengers often grumble about baggage charges and other fees, but airlines love them.</seg>
<seg id="18">They argue that luggage costs money to handle, and passengers who want the service should pay for it.</seg>
<seg id="19">Many on Wall Street view the addition of baggage fees as a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.</seg>
<seg id="20">Most haven't touched carry-on bag fees, though.</seg>
<seg id="21">Spirit Airlines Inc. started the first carry-on fee three years ago, and fellow discounter Allegiant Air later followed.</seg>
<seg id="22">The only other airline with such a fee is Hungary's Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely tracks add-on fees.</seg>
<seg id="23">He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit's carry-on fee brings in $50 million a year.</seg>
<seg id="24">Sorensen, a former executive with Midwest Airlines, flew Spirit recently and wondered what he'd find at the gate as passengers encountered Spirit's unusual carry-on bag fee.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The boarding process was the smoothest I had seen in my airline career," he said.</seg>
<seg id="26">I was expecting to see gnashing of teeth and a fight breaking out at the gate.</seg>
<seg id="27">The plane was full, he said, "and it boarded lickety-split."</seg>
<seg id="28">Frontier is also following Spirit's $2 charge for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.</seg>
<seg id="29">Frontier said passengers who get soda or juice can keep the whole can, and it will give coffee refills for free.</seg>
<seg id="30">It will still give away water.</seg>
<seg id="31">US Airways briefly tried charging for beverages in 2008 but backed down seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airline followed.</seg>
<seg id="32">Frontier's move to charge the carry-on fee if passengers don't buy direct from the airline is its latest effort to steer customers toward its own website.</seg>
<seg id="33">Airlines pay online travel sellers such as Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.</seg>
<seg id="34">That has given all airlines an incentive to steer passengers to buy directly from them instead of going through an online travel agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">Frontier has gone the furthest in this area, though.</seg>
<seg id="36">In September it began giving half as many frequent flier miles to customers who bought through an online travel agency.</seg>
<seg id="37">On Wednesday it slashed the mileage award to 25 percent of the miles of the trip.</seg>
<seg id="38">So, a 1,000 mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles.</seg>
<seg id="39">It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy directly from the Frontier website.</seg>
<seg id="40">Frontier has a loyal base of customers in its home city of Denver, but its business is shrinking and losing money.</seg>
<seg id="41">Revenue dropped 9 percent and its flying capacity shrank almost 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by corporate parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc.</seg>
<seg id="42">Republic has been trying to fix Frontier's finances as part of selling the airline.</seg>

<seg id="1">Arts subsidy: Down with the capital's cultural monopoly</seg>
<seg id="2">There were two great moments for regional arts.</seg>
<seg id="3">One was the heyday of the Victorian philanthropist, when captains of industry commissioned temples of culture where they themselves lived and worked.</seg>
<seg id="4">Great galleries were built across the industrial North, and crammed with masterpieces for the benefit of the people.</seg>
<seg id="5">Many still bear the names of their founders.</seg>
<seg id="6">The second, in my view, was in the 1970s, when a notion that culture should be properly devolved gave rise to new theatres and arts centres across the country.</seg>
<seg id="7">The picture, now, is sadly diminished.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sure, the wonderful galleries across the North - in Manchester, Liverpool, Durham, Newcastle and Hull - are still there, with their treasure troves of beauty and wonder.</seg>
<seg id="9">The magnificent theatres are there, too.</seg>
<seg id="10">But too often the theatres are dark, or given over to soap stars in panto, while the galleries, limping along on local funding, are open in a sort of desultory, half-hearted manner.</seg>
<seg id="11">The National Gallery and Tate make an effort, by lending key works to regional collections or (in the case of Tate) farming out the Turner Prize.</seg>
<seg id="12">The National Theatre does go on tour.</seg>
<seg id="13">But this is simply lip service.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the main, everything, culturally, points to London.</seg>
<seg id="15">This is where great exhibitions are displayed, important plays staged, operas sung.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Oh, but these are all streamed online, so everyone can see them," they say.</seg>
<seg id="17">What?</seg>
<seg id="18">Have you ever had that glorious tingle provoked by the rise of a red curtain, watching a play on a computer?</seg>
<seg id="19">Yes, people could see the sell-out Leonardo exhibition at the National Gallery on television, but it simply did not compare to the experience of standing before the masterpieces.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nor do the much vaunted broadcasts of opera or theatre from the South Bank or Covent Garden.</seg>
<seg id="21">Are they a valid substitute?</seg>
<seg id="22">Not really.</seg>
<seg id="23">You need to hear the scrape of the bows on violins, see the spittle flying out of the mouths of the actors.</seg>
<seg id="24">We have the venues outside London.</seg>
<seg id="25">Take the shows there, so that people whose taxes have paid for them can see them.</seg>
<seg id="26">There is simply no way around it.</seg>
<seg id="27">Most people in this country live outside of London.</seg>
<seg id="28">And most arts cash is spent inside London.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is unfair.</seg>
<seg id="30">And it renders it inaccessible.</seg>
<seg id="31">So what if the British Museum's exhibition was free for children?</seg>
<seg id="32">My sister, living in Worcester, would have had to spend at least £100 on fares and tickets to bring her two children to see it.</seg>
<seg id="33">On a day trip.</seg>
<seg id="34">Stay overnight, and you are looking at a £300 bill.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Arts Council must do better.</seg>
<seg id="36">Open up the regional galleries.</seg>
<seg id="37">Fund regional theatres.</seg>
<seg id="38">Insist on proper tours of exhibitions, plays, and operas.</seg>
<seg id="39">Our arts may well be world famous, but they are not shared, at all, between the people who pay for them.</seg>

<seg id="2">Taking advantage of Halloween, a woman tried to smuggle two kilos of cocaine hidden inside pumpkins into the country through Montreal-Trudeau Airport on Thursday morning.</seg>
<seg id="3">The drugs were detected when passenger luggage was checked.</seg>
<seg id="4">The cocaine was split between three pumpkins that had been previously hollowed out.</seg>
<seg id="5">The drugs were subsequently taken to the office of the Royal Gendarmerie of Canada (GRC), which then took over the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not reveal where the woman had been travelling from when she was intercepted.</seg>
<seg id="7">"That is part of the investigation," indicated Jacqueline Roby, spokesperson for the CBSA.</seg>
<seg id="8">"What I can tell you is that she was entering the country."</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the start of 2013, the Canada Border Services Agency at Montreal-Trudeau Airport has conducted 173 drugs seizures, of which 10 involved seizures of cocaine totaling 44 kilograms.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pierre Nora's Two Frances</seg>
<seg id="2">Perplexed by his work, academics have long struggled to define and place Pierre Nora.</seg>
<seg id="3">Is he a professor in lecture halls and classrooms?</seg>
<seg id="4">Of course, but with emphasis on his fondness for byroads, at Sciences-Po (French Institute of Political Sciences), and Hautes Etudes (School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences).</seg>
<seg id="5">Does he play an arbiter of the work of others from his office in Rue Gaston-Gallimard?</seg>
<seg id="6">Yes, but while ignoring his lesser known work and underground writing as an editor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Is he the heir to Fontenelle's chair at the Académie Française?</seg>
<seg id="8">Yes again, but he knows that such an honour cannot replace the real holy oil, the philosophical work, which he has foregone.</seg>
<seg id="9">They have gladly acknowledged him as a great awakener, a driving force, a unifier of their work, but observed that he seemed disinclined to produce such work himself.</seg>
<seg id="10">The monumental "Lieux de mémoire" (places of memory), to which his name is attached, has also contributed to this unclear image.</seg>
<seg id="11">Scandal-mongers have regarded this work as a gigantic "flea market", presented by an intelligent and very learned commentator with a keen eye, but who is an incurable "dabbler".</seg>
<seg id="12">The two works published by Nora almost two years ago have already proven that though he appeared not to write, he had written - plentifully and well.</seg>
<seg id="13">This book should definitively do him justice.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, once again, there is a tendency towards ubiquity, intellectual roaming, jubilation in jumping, as if with both feet tied,from one subject to another.</seg>
<seg id="15">Nevertheless, one quickly understands that the disparate objects gathered together in this beautifully titled book lead the "second-hand goods dealer" to a constant passion, that of discovering the core that makes up the French identity.</seg>
<seg id="16">Why these dramatic appeals for national unity?</seg>
<seg id="17">Identity is a contemporary preoccupation.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not long ago, we were asked to collectively define it.</seg>
<seg id="19">But, in the peremptory minds of our former leaders, French identity was a timeless essence.</seg>
<seg id="20">All it took was to highlight its mistakes and, in keeping with Jacobinism, the issue would be entrusted to prefects and sub-prefects - the authorised interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="21">What Pierre Nora is searching for is something else.</seg>
<seg id="22">He does not position himself as an heir to an eternal Frenchness; he rejects the definition.</seg>
<seg id="23">As an analyst anxious about a familiar strangeness, he wanders in a forest of symbols, stops after each step to examine an object in the form of a puzzle, tormented by irritating questions,</seg>
<seg id="24">such as this, which arises from the undertaking itself: why, in a country so permanently established within its frontiers, with such an ancient structure and that is so solidly built, do we hear these dramatic calls for unity?</seg>
<seg id="25">The calls are pressing only because of the need to ward off the trouble caused by discord in French history, says Nora.</seg>
<seg id="26">Franks and Gauls, Armagnacs and Burgundians, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division in this country are very ancient.</seg>
<seg id="27">And the most emblematic is clearly that which split national history in two:</seg>
<seg id="28">since the upheaval of the Revolution, the French have had two histories and two nations - one monarchic, the other revolutionary.</seg>
<seg id="29">The second tried to kill off the first, but failed to wipe it out; on the contrary, it was wary of letting it rediscover its sacredness and was so eager for unity and indivisibility that it cut off the head of the person who was the evident and powerful incarnation of the two.</seg>
<seg id="30">And from there was born an invincibly bipartite nation, split into left and right, lay and Catholic, adoration and hatred for the Revolution.</seg>
<seg id="31">To understand this unique aspect of the French identity, there is nothing better than taking a short trip outside of metropolitan France, so much so that Pierre Nora's American venture could be the heart of his book.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is because America and France have both had a revolution, drawn up a declaration of rights, and tried to found a new society.</seg>
<seg id="33">However, our familiarity with America only emphasises even more something that is particular to us.</seg>
<seg id="34">Over there, people abandoned their former rulers in England and did not have to bother about them any more.</seg>
<seg id="35">Here, people were bothered by a native old power, and were all the more radical for it.</seg>
<seg id="36">Over there, the revolution was consensual, whereas here it engendered tragedy and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="37">There, the founding fathers are still honoured, but here, our revolutionary ancestors are hardly used as role models, besides, they killed each other.</seg>
<seg id="38">There, there has been institutional consistency; here there has been a torrent of constitutions, so many mistakes to correct and tests to repeat:</seg>
<seg id="39">the France on the way out, the France in the making.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, there has been a time when the French believed they could repair the damage done to their history and overcome the curse of the number two.</seg>
<seg id="41">Pierre Nora has shown has shown great interest and even tenderness for this Third Republic: he salutes those who tried at the time to repair the divide created by the Revolution by teaching students about everything in the former France that obscurely paved the way for the modern France, and by offering them a unified version of their history.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yet, this pacified identity has had its day.</seg>
<seg id="43">Here we are in debate once again, shaken by a new type of immigration, threatened by the inflow of protesting minorities, absorbed into the European framework.</seg>
<seg id="44">The book thus offers both a fascinating portrait of the France on the way out, and a circumspect outline of the France in the making.</seg>
<seg id="45">And, on top of that, there is the portrait of the historian, which should hold some surprises.</seg>
<seg id="46">It reveals that the wanderer liked to stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="47">The man of many curiosities is - slightly obsessively - focused on a single idea.</seg>
<seg id="48">The one who prowled at the edges was standing in the heart of the centre.</seg>
<seg id="49">And the man who rejected a notion of a nation over half a century ago, but who escaped from the initiatory exercise of the philosophical work, confides in us, cum grano salis, that he has ended up doing it after all.</seg>
<seg id="50">And so he has, but in a less formal, and more exploded and subtle form.</seg>
<seg id="51">A form, which - make no mistake - is just as restrictive,</seg>
<seg id="52">because, over and above the format imposed in the university course, this philosophical work speaks of the inner necessity of a life.</seg>

<seg id="2">Horner tips Ricciardo to surprise against Vettel next year.</seg>
<seg id="3">RED Bull boss Christian Horner has tipped young Australian Daniel Ricciardo to be a surprise packet next season despite the "daunting" task of partnering four-time Formula 1 champion Sebastian Vettel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ricciardo will replace compatriot Mark Webber at the Milton Keynes-based team, who will be chasing a fifth successive constructors' title in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 24-year-old, much like his current teammate Jean-Eric Vergne, is signed to Red Bull Racing and has been on loan at their junior outfit Torro Rosso since the start of the 2012 season.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was chosen ahead of candidates including 2007 world champion Kimi Raikkonen to partner Vettel next year, and team principal Horner has no concerns Ricciardo could struggle in the high profile spot alongside the all-conquering German.</seg>
<seg id="7">"He knows it is big shoes (to fill)," Horner said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Obviously to go up against Sebastian Vettel is a pretty daunting prospect for any driver but Daniel is a young guy that has got a lot raw talent and a great amount of natural speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">""He knows the team pretty well.</seg>
<seg id="10">I think he has got exactly the right character and approach to get the most out of the experience, to learn from Sebastian and embrace being his teammate.</seg>
<seg id="11">I genuinely think he will be a bit of a surprise next year.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ricciardo, whose first race in Formula One came with the now-defunct Hispania team at the back end of 2011, has finished in the points in two of the five grands prix since the announcement of his move to Red Bull, and Horner is keen for the driver to maintain his current commitment to Torro Rosso.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Of course we have some dialogue," Horner said.</seg>
<seg id="14">We have more so now with Daniel as he starts to prepare himself to make the transition across.</seg>
<seg id="15">""But first of all he needs to focus on and finish the job he has got to do with Torro Rosso before involving him fully in the program for next year.""</seg>
<seg id="16">With another drivers' title sewn up for Vettel in India, where the team also bagged their fourth constructors' championship in succession, Red Bull are in Abu Dhabi this week with less to race for.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Horner insists they will not be ending a memorable season with a whimper.</seg>
<seg id="18">""It is still important to put ourselves under pressure," he said."</seg>
<seg id="19">""Sometimes if you relax in any sport, that is when you make mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="20">Our approach is very much to keep the pressure on ourselves between now and the chequered flag in Brazil.</seg>
<seg id="21">It would be great to see Mark get up the championship order and have a few strong races and Sebastian is very focused on adding to his 10 victories this year - there is still plenty of motivation.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ben Greenman: The Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker</seg>
<seg id="2">One could argue that New York City is the birthplace of standup comedy in America: nearly a hundred years ago, the vaudevillian Frank Fay, who served as the master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, started telling jokes directly to the crowd, in a conversational manner.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fay's innovation has been extended through the years, most recently by the New York Comedy Festival.</seg>
<seg id="4">Created and overseen by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the standup institution Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than sixty shows at small clubs and large theatres.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Most of these headliners appeared at Carolines, and went on to greater success, to the point where they're too big to play a club," Hirsch said.</seg>
<seg id="6">We built this festival as a way of continuing to work with them.</seg>
<seg id="7">This year's event includes appearances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin, and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes," an annual music-and-comedy benefit for military veterans, at Madison Square Garden, featuring, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby.</seg>
<seg id="8">As the festival has expanded, so has the world of comedy.</seg>
<seg id="9">Several of the comedians participating in this year's festival came up through nontraditional channels, such as shows on smaller networks, like Comedy Central, FX, and Spike.</seg>
<seg id="10">Nick Kroll rose to prominence on a deep-cable sitcom (FXX's gleefully raunchy fantasy-football-themed "The League") and now has his own Comedy Central sketch show.</seg>
<seg id="11">Jenny Slate has been a cast member on both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation," though she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On."</seg>
<seg id="12">Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with distinctive voices (the surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the wry, racially focussed W. Kamau Bell), are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.</seg>
<seg id="13">One of the festival's biggest draws will be an interview: David Steinberg talking to Larry David.</seg>
<seg id="14">Steinberg started as a standup comedian but has become an accomplished television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a show on TV Land called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg."</seg>
<seg id="16">The meeting takes place at Town Hall, in the center of Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all of Larry's work," Steinberg said.</seg>
<seg id="18">He was telling me that, when he's here, sometimes he'll walk down an alley between two buildings and think to himself, Hey, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here.</seg>

<seg id="1">Croc hunt will endanger humans</seg>
<seg id="2">CONSERVATIONIST Bob Irwin says a plan for trophy hunters to kill up to 50 saltwater crocodiles in the Northern Territory each year could result in more attacks against humans.</seg>
<seg id="3">Mr Irwin, the father of Steve Croc Hunter Irwin who died in 2006 after being hit by a stingray barb, said the plan made no sense.</seg>
<seg id="4">Under the proposed hunt, up to 50 saltwater crocodiles above 3.5m in size will be able to be killed each year by people seeking trophies.</seg>
<seg id="5">"What worries me is that when you take those big dominant male crocodiles out of a river system that then allows the teenage crocs to run riot," Mr Irwin told AAP.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I believe we are going to upset the system to the point where there will be more of a threat to humans than there actually is now," he said.</seg>
<seg id="7">They will test their predatory skills and hopefully there isn't anyone in the way.</seg>
<seg id="8">Federal environment minister Tony Burke has agreed to let the public comment on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="9">After the consultation phase ends on July 25 the Minister will make a decision on whether to allow a two-year hunting period.</seg>
<seg id="10">The NT Government said yesterday that they are very hopeful the trial will get the green light.</seg>
<seg id="11">Crocodile hunting was banned in the 1970s, after the number of the crocodiles in the NT crashed to low levels.</seg>
<seg id="12">The NT Government has said the current plan will boost tourism and help remote indigenous communities earn income and will not reduce overall numbers of crocodiles.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr Irwin said indigenous communities could earn more money by taking tourists to see crocodiles in the wild than taking hunters.</seg>
<seg id="14">He said his famous son would be "turning in his grave" to hear that NT crocodiles could be hunted for sport.</seg>

<seg id="20">The court heard that Lady Kelly Hadfield-Hyde and Ann Chadwick had shared an early-morning bottle of wine, although in evidence, Hadfield Hyde denied being drunk.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Mirror's website has the video of the pair, but the paper edition carries a sequence of pictures, with five pun-filled captions - take off, bosom buddies, turbulent (this is when another friend intervenes), winging it (the friend tries to cover up the other mum) and, lastly, breast behaviour (the pair finally cover up).</seg>
<seg id="22">And finally, "Frankenstein's mogster" is the Mirror's headline to a story about animal corpses found in freezers in a house in Warsaw, Poland.</seg>

<seg id="1">Science inspires, so don't let your art rule your head</seg>
<seg id="2">There is no conflict between art and science: only the wide-eyed pursuit of cool ideas.</seg>
<seg id="3">The previous two collections in the excellent The Best Australian Science Writing 2013 series have contained forewords written by Nobel laureates, so in pursuit of balance - I assume - this year's foreword is written by someone who is quite spectacularly not one.</seg>
<seg id="4">Therefore, rather than say something knowledgeable or insightful, I'll begin with the dental health of the people of Oregon, USA.</seg>
<seg id="5">I've only been to Portland once, but it's a great city - its population a paragon of liberalism and artiness, sporting more tattoos than you could point a regretful laser at, and boasting perhaps a higher collective dye-to-hair ratio than anywhere on earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Great music, great art, wonderful coffee ... it's my kind of town.</seg>
<seg id="7">Except, the residents recently voted - for the fourth time since the 1950s - against adding fluoride to the water supply.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's as if a mermaid on one's lower back is an impediment to sensible interpretation of data, or perhaps unkempt pink hair acts as a sort of dream catcher for conspiracy theories.</seg>
<seg id="9">This apparent inverse correlation between artistic interest and scientific literacy seems to play out all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">Go to Byron Bay and you'll find more painters and musos per capita than anywhere in the country, and - inevitably - a parallel glut of aura readers, homeopaths and anti-vaccination campaigners.</seg>
<seg id="11">There's clearly no such thing as a free lunch: you want to listen to good blues, you have to have your palm read - and maybe get measles in the process.</seg>
<seg id="12">As an artist who gets aroused by statistics - among other things - I find this deeply troubling.</seg>
<seg id="13">But I reckon (and yes, I only reckon: one of many advantages of being a not-Nobel-laureate is that I may hypothesise with relative impunity) that the apparent relationship between artiness and anti-science is a result of people acting out cultural expectations and subscribing to popular myths, rather than a genuine division of personality type or intellect.</seg>
<seg id="14">I wonder if artists identify themselves as spiritual (whatever that means) and reject materialism for the same reason they might wear a beret or take up smoking: it's an adherence to a perceived stereotype, rather than a fundamental feature of the creative brain.</seg>
<seg id="15">Science is a masculine trait and art a feminine trait; people are either "right-brained" or "left-brained" thinkers; a materialist world view is an impediment to the imagination; you need to believe in magic to write magically - all these tropes are familiar to us, and all of them myths.</seg>
<seg id="16">Or if they're not entirely myths, they are nevertheless dull and unproductive categorisations.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the heart of some artists' anti-scientific world view is the suspicion science is unromantic.</seg>
<seg id="18">The beauty of the human form is best revealed with charcoal, not with a scalpel.</seg>
<seg id="19">Love should be expressed in a sonnet, not measured with an MRI.</seg>
<seg id="20">A sunset may be photographed or painted or reflected in song, but getting excited by its rate of fusion or the fact it represents pretty much all the mass in the solar system is seen as somehow unpoetic.</seg>
<seg id="21">And further into it: the fruit of the tree of knowledge will rob you of paradise.</seg>
<seg id="22">Facts are the opposite of inspiration.</seg>
<seg id="23">Scientists are cold, boring, and amoral.</seg>
<seg id="24">If you reject the spiritual you will never access the sublime.</seg>
<seg id="25">Of course, I'm building a straw man only to burn him.</seg>
<seg id="26">Science is not a bunch of facts.</seg>
<seg id="27">Scientists are not people trying to be prescriptive or authoritative.</seg>
<seg id="28">Science is simply the word we use to describe a method of organising our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="29">It's easier, at a dinner party, to say "science" than to say "the incremental acquisition of understanding through observation, humbled by an acute awareness of our tendency towards bias."</seg>
<seg id="30">Douglas Adams said: "I'd take the awe of understanding over the awe of ignorance any day."</seg>
<seg id="31">Science is not the opposite of art, nor the opposite of spirituality - whatever that is - and you don't have to deny scientific knowledge in order to make beautiful things.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the contrary, great science writing is the art of communicating that "awe of understanding," so that we readers can revel in the beauty of a deeper knowledge of our world.</seg>
<seg id="33">This volume is a small, exciting and illuminating reminder that art and science feed off each other, need each other, are each other.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is the foreword from The Best Australian Science Writing 2013 (NewSouth at UNSW Press, $29.99).</seg>

<seg id="1">End of the Road for Elysée Head Chef</seg>
<seg id="2">Having entered the 500m2-space of the kitchens at the Elysée Palace as an assistant after working in embassies, the cook climbed up the ladder to become head chef nine years ago.</seg>
<seg id="3">He has served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to Nicolas Sarkozy and François Hollande, including at their holiday homes, and fed an uncountable number of world figures, surrounded by a cloud of anonymity that he has only emerged from today, as he retires at 60.</seg>
<seg id="4">Born on 24 October 1953 in La Ferté-Saint-Aubin, the man with an open face, a balding head and the glasses of an intellectual is the holder of a certificate of professional competence in confectionery.</seg>
<seg id="5">His mother was a cook in a château in Sologne.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I've moved from one château to another!" says Bernard Vaussion ironically. He is familiar, not only with the habits of the six presidents for whom he has cooked, but also with those of their wives and some of their illustrious guests.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It's always the Head of State or his partner or wife who chooses the menu," he recalls.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Madame Chirac was a little more involved and would come right into the kitchen," to the point where she forbade women to enter the kitchens in the Elysée Palace!</seg>
<seg id="9">With all due respect to heads of state who appeared relatively indifferent to fruits of the earth, "they are all fond of food" Bernard Vaussion reveals graciously.</seg>
<seg id="10">Jacques Chirac certainly had a "more refined palate".</seg>
<seg id="11">But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who forbade cheese, the plates always came back empty!</seg>
<seg id="12">François Hollande, who reintroduced cheese, is "a man who likes to eat" and "he is not very choosy".</seg>
<seg id="13">The current Head of State, who has put back on the pounds he lost during the presidential campaign, does "not have a specific diet requirement".</seg>
<seg id="14">Bernard Vaussion also recalls the pressure that would rest on his shoulders, especially during state dinners at the Elysée, where one had to serve "between 200 and 250 people in around an hour".</seg>
<seg id="15">The night before would be practically sleepless.</seg>
<seg id="16">Such people would not understand if something went wrong.</seg>
<seg id="17">The now former head chef at the Elysée, who shared a drink on Tuesday evening with his team, his family and friends, is leaving with a twinge of sorrow. "François Hollande came to say goodbye."</seg>
<seg id="18">He was full of praise.</seg>
<seg id="19">"His human side came out," he recalls.</seg>
<seg id="20">The chef will be replaced by his assistant, 35-year-old Guillaume Gomez, who has been at the Elysée for seventeen years himself.</seg>

<seg id="1">Heat on Corey Norman to be electric Eel</seg>
<seg id="2">VAST POTENTIAL: Darren Lockyer believes Corey Norman is destined to play five-eighth for Queensland.</seg>
<seg id="3">Picture: Bradley Kanaris Source: Getty Images</seg>
<seg id="4">FOR Corey Norman, so much has changed in the past 12 months yet he is in pretty much the same position as 2012 when he started that season with immense promise.</seg>
<seg id="5">He is, I still believe, a future Queensland Origin No.6 but he has much to learn, as most 22-year-old footballers do.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is now six weeks since Parramatta announced Norman would be joining them in 2014 as their first-choice five-eighth.</seg>
<seg id="7">He was disappointed he didn't get the No.6 position at the Broncos this year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Corey was still finding his feet as an NRL fullback when he signed and he has since played some terrific football.</seg>
<seg id="9">Maybe he is more relaxed because the decision has been made.</seg>
<seg id="10">For some players it is a load off their shoulders to have the pressure of the negotiations over.</seg>
<seg id="11">I do a little work with some of the Broncos players.</seg>
<seg id="12">Before he signed with Parramatta, I was keen to know where his head was at, but concluded he wanted to go to the Eels, and if that was what he wanted, then good luck to him.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Eels have a way to go to be a consistent force in this competition.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ricky Stuart has said as much and I reckon Corey would know it by now.</seg>
<seg id="15">Parramatta were poor against Penrith two rounds ago and better against the Cowboys.</seg>
<seg id="16">Consistency will be a challenge this season.</seg>
<seg id="17">Corey will have to go to Parramatta willing to undergo a tough period in which he has to develop himself as a No.6 and as a leader.</seg>
<seg id="18">I don't know if he will enjoy his football as much as he is at the Broncos.</seg>
<seg id="19">It will be a time for perseverance and also belief in what his coach is trying to put into place around him.</seg>
<seg id="20">Ricky is an intense football person.</seg>
<seg id="21">Corey will need to understand how to work with Ricky and develop during the pre-season as the sort of player and man the coach wants in such a key position.</seg>
<seg id="22">Eels fans will have big expectations of what Corey can do for them and I can see him taking some time to find his feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">Playing fullback now is not so much about finishing opportunities, but creating them.</seg>
<seg id="24">Out wide, Corey has been able to make the most of those block plays and he is also taking the line on.</seg>
<seg id="25">He has made a few mistakes under the high ball and his team needs him to rectify those problems.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those errors can be costly because most of them are on your own tryline.</seg>
<seg id="27">Playing No.1 for the Broncos this year is not a bad thing for Corey.</seg>
<seg id="28">He can learn from Peter Wallace and Scott Prince in the main playmaking roles.</seg>
<seg id="29">A fullback can be the difference in an NRL game.</seg>
<seg id="30">But a half needs to know how to be his side's general.</seg>
<seg id="31">While he might lose a few games with Parra next year, he will do well to ask himself: "Why did we lose?"</seg>
<seg id="32">What do we need to do better this week?</seg>
<seg id="33">Tonight, I expect Corey to be on the winning side.</seg>
<seg id="34">The Broncos lost control of the game against South Sydney last Friday night in a 10-minute period in the second half through a lack of intensity, which could be seen in their defence and their kick-chase.</seg>
<seg id="35">Souths showed what can happen against the top sides if you drop your guard for any period of time in an arm wrestle-type contest.</seg>

<seg id="1">A rosy outlook for green bonds, but valuations will be key for investors</seg>
<seg id="2">Globe editors have posted this research report with permission of TD Economics.</seg>
<seg id="3">Green bonds are a debt instrument issued to raise capital that is used exclusively to support projects with specific environmental benefits.</seg>
<seg id="4">They help raise funds for environmental initiatives at a time when governments are strapped for cash.</seg>
<seg id="5">The first green bond that directed the use of proceeds was issued just six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a result, it is a relatively new financial instrument and has yet to conform to a standardized format.</seg>
<seg id="7">Institutional investors are the most natural client-base for green bonds.</seg>
<seg id="8">These investors hold 72 per cent of long-term investment in the world's $95-trillion (U.S.) bond market and have demonstrated demand for environmental investment products.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, individuals are becoming increasingly exposed to green bonds, directly through portfolio diversification and indirectly through mutual funds.</seg>
<seg id="10">Lack of a standardized format makes estimating the size of the green bond market difficult.</seg>
<seg id="11">Market characteristics vary based on how the instrument is defined, with current estimates placing the value of the market between $10-billion and $346-billion.</seg>
<seg id="12">However all estimates indicate that the demand for green bonds is significant and has been growing rapidly over the past six years</seg>
<seg id="13">Green bonds are a good way to secure large amounts of capital to support many different environmental investments.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, they are not ideal for all types of projects, specifically high-risk ventures.</seg>
<seg id="15">The outlook for green bonds is very promising, but they are still subject to the same valuation analysis as any other debt instrument.</seg>
<seg id="16">In order for green bonds to attain mainstream success, their structure, rate of return and risk profile must be similar to traditional bonds.</seg>

<seg id="2">A 21-year-old Sydney woman sentenced to 15 days jail in Phuket for falsely claiming she was assaulted by a taxi driver is appealing the verdict and has been granted bail.</seg>
<seg id="3">Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a Phuket provincial court on June 15 of making false claims after telling Thai police a local taxi driver, with two other men restraining her, carried out the assault in the early hours of Sunday June 10.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, CCTV footage later revealed she had returned to her hotel safely after becoming separated from her Australian boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="5">Phuket police interviewed Bamford for two days before she confessed to fabricating the story.</seg>
<seg id="6">She was held in local police cells before the court hearing.</seg>
<seg id="7">Bamford was sentenced to serve the 15-day prison term at a low security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket rather than in an adult women's jail.</seg>
<seg id="8">She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who has appealed to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra to assist his daughter.</seg>
<seg id="9">Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph the whole family was "extremely concerned" about his daughter's welfare and wanted her back in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="10">"It's obviously been a worrying time but we're hopeful to have her back home safely as soon as possible," Tunks said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bamford is appealing the sentence and has been granted bail of 50,000 baht.</seg>
<seg id="12">Reports in Australia said that in the meantime, she was holidaying at the resort area of Krabi in Southern Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="13">Thai-based legal sources said Bamford was being represented by a local lawyer in Phuket but warned that the appeal may lead to the court increasing her sentence by up to two years and forcing her to serve it in an adult prison.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, following the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also be looking to repair its battered tourist image, leading to an acquittal.</seg>

<seg id="1">EU has 'limited options' for Greece, says former central banker Axel Weber</seg>
<seg id="2">Former Bundesbank chief Axel Weber.</seg>
<seg id="3">FORMER Bundesbank chief Axel Weber said Europe needs to consider guaranteeing all Greece's outstanding debt because Athens's only viable alternative is a messy default that would be more costly and risk sparking broader financial turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mr Weber, in his first interview since leaving the Bundesbank and the governing council of the European Central Bank at the end of April, said Europe's response to the crisis so far addressed Greece's immediate funding needs without offering the country a credible, long-term resolution for paring its growing mountain of debt.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Ultimately, solving the Greek debt problem will have to deal with the outstanding, past amount of debt, and there are, unfortunately, only very limited options: Either a default or partial haircuts or a guarantee for the outstanding amount of Greek debt," Mr Weber said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Governments have to decide which option they want to go for, but the current piecemeal approach of repeated aid programs inevitably leads to the latter solution.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even after his resignation, Mr Weber, 54 years old, remains an influential, if controversial, figure in European economic circles.</seg>
<seg id="8">His comments on Greece will likely draw notice in Berlin and other capitals as leaders grapple with the latest flare-up of a crisis that has plagued the Continent for nearly two years.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since announcing his departure, Mr Weber has frequently been named as a potential successor to Deutsche Bank chief executive Josef Ackermann, whose contract expires in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr Weber didn't rule out going to work in the private sector, but said he had a contract to teach central banking at the University of Chicago until May of next year.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said he hadn't decided what to do after that, but added that he wouldn't pursue another policy-making position.</seg>
<seg id="12">Issuing guarantees could help persuade Greece's creditors to exchange the debt they currently hold for new bonds with longer maturities, effectively giving Athens more time to pay back its loans.</seg>
<seg id="13">Europe's banks, which hold much of Greece's debt, are resisting rolling over their Greek bonds unless they receive incentives, such as guarantees that that the debt will be repaid.</seg>
<seg id="14">Germany and other European countries have so far resisted making guarantees, arguing that it is in banks' best interest to participate voluntarily.</seg>
<seg id="15">Yet Europe's leaders also are concerned about sparking a broader market panic, and have consistently rejected suggestions that Athens reduce its debt burden by forcing investors to accept less than they are owed, a so-called haircut -- or worse, default on its obligations altogether.</seg>
<seg id="16">Europe's prescription for Greece to overcome its debt problems involves a program of severe public-spending cuts, privatisation of state-owned assets and a "voluntary" agreement by creditors to give Athens more time to meet its obligations.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many investors and economists maintain that Greece's debt load, at 350 billion euros ($473.4bn), or 155 per cent of its forecast economic output this year, is simply too large for Europe's current strategy to work.</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr Weber's comments add a prominent voice to that chorus, reflecting growing frustration in Europe over a failure to address what many consider the root causes of the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="19">"At some point you've got to cut your losses and restart the system," Mr Weber said, drawing parallels between the guarantee approach for Greek debt and the steps Germany and other countries took during the financial crisis to backstop troubled banks.</seg>
<seg id="20">"The Greek problem is not a short-term problem and...it was not caused by the common currency," Mr Weber said.</seg>
<seg id="21">Instead it's a deep-rooted, fiscal and structural problem that probably needs more a 30-year time horizon to solve rather than a three- to five-year horizon.</seg>
<seg id="22">The measures Europe needs to adopt to resolve this issue are much more profound than just short-term liquidity funds.</seg>
<seg id="23">Critics argue that debt guarantees would backfire by setting incentives for countries to overspend, a threat often referred to as "moral hazard."</seg>
<seg id="24">To avoid that, Mr Weber said Greece and other euro-zone countries that receive bailouts should be compelled to sharpen clauses in future bond contracts stipulating that investors will automatically bear losses if a country needs a bailout.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most countries have dismissed such proposals amid concerns that acknowledging the possibility of a default would cause their borrowing costs to rise.</seg>
<seg id="26">"What ought to be reinvigorated are the incentives that, in the future, countries have to face the responsibility for their own debt that they issue in the market," Mr Weber said.</seg>
<seg id="27">But to get to that point we'll have to deal with the legacy of outstanding debt.</seg>
<seg id="28">Resistance to debt guarantees has been particularly strong in Germany and other countries in the euro-zone's northern tier, where popular pushback against the rescues of Greece and other periphery countries is strongest.</seg>
<seg id="29">Yet over the past year, the private sector has receded as Greece's main creditor as European governments extended loans to Greece so it could meet its obligations.</seg>
<seg id="30">With Europe's taxpayers holding the bulk of Greece's debt, public resistance to guarantees could soften.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr Weber, who had been widely considered a leading contender to become the next head of the European Central Bank until his surprise resignation in February, clashed with his ECB colleagues over their decision last year to help stem the crisis by purchasing the government debt of Greece and other countries.</seg>
<seg id="32">He argued then that the move threatened both the central bank's independence from politics and its reputation as steward of the region's common currency.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the interview, he described the dispute as a "watershed" moment that prompted his decision to step down several months later.</seg>
<seg id="34">He warned that the ECB was again overstepping its mandate by participating in negotiations alongside the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund with Greece and other countries over their austerity programs.</seg>
<seg id="35">Mr Weber says the ECB should limit its role to monetary policy and not become involved in fiscal policy, which he argues injects it too deeply into the political process.</seg>

<seg id="2">All on-duty firefighters due to strike in London are being recalled over the blaze at a scrap metal yard being attended by 120 of their colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="3">There are 20 fire engines attending the scene on Perry Road, Dagenham, east London, where the London Fire Brigade (LFB) say there are around 1,500 tonnes of metal alight.</seg>
<seg id="4">Cylinders are also believed to be involved and a hazard zone has been put in place in case they explode due to the intense heat.</seg>
<seg id="5">There are around 1,500 tonnes of metal alight.</seg>

<seg id="7">With black smoke coming from the site, which can be seen from miles around, residents are being advised to keep their doors and windows closed.</seg>
<seg id="8">Of the 27 fire appliances in operation for contingency, 20 have already been allocated to the Dagenham fire.</seg>
<seg id="9">LFB said that, because of the major blaze, all striking FBU staff who would normally be on duty were immediately being recalled to their stations.</seg>
<seg id="10">This was under the agreed "Recall to Duty Procedure" and was voluntary, it said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="11">Smoke can be seen from miles around.</seg>

<seg id="13">Scotland Yard said police officers and ambulance crews were also at the scene.</seg>
<seg id="14">There are no reported injuries, but there are local road closures in place and motorists are advised to avoid the area if possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">London Fire Commissioner Ron Dobson said: "We have issued a recall notice and are asking striking Fire Brigades Union members in London to carry on working.</seg>
<seg id="16">The FBU have told firefighters not to follow the recall notice.</seg>
<seg id="17">They claim the recall is not valid because there is no risk to life.</seg>
<seg id="18">There is no reference to risk of life in the agreed protocols to implement a major incident.</seg>
<seg id="19">A major incident can and has been implemented because of the size of this fire and the resources needed to deal with it.</seg>
<seg id="20">By not responding to the recall it is the FBU that is in breach of the agreement.</seg>
<seg id="21">No one from the FBU was available to comment.</seg>
<seg id="22">London Mayor Boris Johnson said: "Londoners will rightly want to see the major incident in Dagenham brought to a speedy and safe conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="23">I fully support the Fire Commissioner's decision to recall all striking FBU staff who would normally be on duty, and I would urge London's dedicated firefighters to do their utmost to help to bring this fire under control.</seg>
<seg id="24">It came as firefighters in the rest of England and Wales went ahead with the strike in their dispute with the Government over pensions, on what was expected to be one of the busiest days of the year for the service ahead of Bonfire Night and Diwali celebrations.</seg>
<seg id="25">Members of the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) walked out at 6.30pm, mounting picket lines outside fire stations until the stoppage ended at 11pm.</seg>
<seg id="26">A further two-hour strike will be held from 6am on Monday, the day before Bonfire Night.</seg>
<seg id="27">Fire brigades across the country urged members of the public to put off any firework displays in their own gardens and to switch it to Saturday, or go to an organised event.</seg>
<seg id="28">The union held a four-hour stoppage last month but called off another strike after it appeared a deal was in sight, but officials said the Government and fire employers had failed to offer any firm guarantees on jobs or pensions as a result of changing the pension age from 55 to 60.</seg>
<seg id="29">The union fears firefighters will be made redundant if they fail fitness tests, and are unable to find other work in the fire service.</seg>
<seg id="30">FBU general secretary Matt Wrack said: "It is ludicrous that after two years of negotiations the Government has still not sorted out this mess.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bombardier profit dips as plane deliveries, orders fall</seg>
<seg id="2">Canadian plane and train maker Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent fall in net profit on Thursday, pressured by fewer aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contract issues in its train unit.</seg>
<seg id="3">Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release any flight test data for its brand-new CSeries aircraft or offer an update on whether the plane will meet its ambitious schedule of going into commercial service by next September.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the test plane's inaugural flight about a month and a half ago, it has only flown three more times, raising questions over whether the testing phase is on track.</seg>
<seg id="5">Results fell short of forecasts and sent shares sliding more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.</seg>
<seg id="6">Cameron Doerksen, an analyst with National Bank Financial, lowered his rating to "sector perform" from "outperform" on Thursday with the view that the stock has limited upside over the next one or two quarters.</seg>
<seg id="7">"While the weaker aircraft deliveries were mostly anticipated, we are clearly disappointed by the margin performance in transportation," Doerksen said in a client note.</seg>
<seg id="8">We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the flight test program progresses.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we suspect that the market will become more skeptical of the program.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bombardier hopes the CSeries aircraft family can catapult it into the low end of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.</seg>
<seg id="11">The first test plane was unveiled in March and took flight for the first time in September after months of delays.</seg>
<seg id="12">But firm orders for the CSeries are moderate so far at 177 as potential buyers wait for flight test results to validate the company's claims about the new jetliner's fuel efficiency and cost savings potential.</seg>
<seg id="13">There are currently 403 total orders and commitments with 15 customers and operators.</seg>
<seg id="14">Chief Executive Officer Pierre Beaudoin was confident Bombardier would meet its 300 firm order target by the time the first jet is put into commercial use.</seg>
<seg id="15">Executives also reassured analysts and media on Thursday the program was progressing according to schedule.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The test plane didn't stay on the ground longer than anticipated," Beaudoin said in a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the plane's downtime.</seg>
<seg id="17">Every manufacturer schedules it in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="18">We had decided to do a first flight and to do an update period and that's what we have done.</seg>
<seg id="19">That will happen all through the flight program.</seg>
<seg id="20">The second of five test planes is expected to take flight in the coming weeks, with the remainder following shortly after, the company said.</seg>
<seg id="21">Still, analysts are skeptical the first customer can begin operating a CSeries plane 12 months after its maiden flight.</seg>
<seg id="22">Bombardier said it was evaluating the entry-into-service (EIS) schedule and will provide an update in the next few months.</seg>
<seg id="23">"This slow pace of flight testing - although in line with Bombardier's internal schedule apparently - reinforces our view that entry-into-service will be pushed to Q1/15," said Doerksen.</seg>
<seg id="24">For the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share a year earlier.</seg>
<seg id="25">Adjusted earnings per share were unchanged at 9 cents.</seg>
<seg id="26">Revenue dipped marginally to $4.1 billion from $4.2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="27">Analysts had expected earnings of 10 cents per share and revenue of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.</seg>
<seg id="28">The world's fourth-largest planemaker said it delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, down from 57 a year earlier.</seg>
<seg id="29">Net orders fell to 26 aircraft, from 83.</seg>
<seg id="30">The backlog in the aerospace division was $32.9 billion as of September 30, unchanged from December 31.</seg>
<seg id="31">"In aerospace, results were in line with our guidance, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were a disappointment," Beaudoin said.</seg>
<seg id="32">Aerospace revenue fell 13 percent to $2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="33">Bombardier, the world's largest trainmaker, said revenue in that division rose nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.</seg>
<seg id="34">The order backlog in the transportation unit was $32.6 billion as of September 30, up marginally from December 31.</seg>
<seg id="35">The transportation division's margins were affected by execution issues in a few large contracts.</seg>
<seg id="36">Executives said new guidance would be provided in the fourth quarter.</seg>
<seg id="37">Shares of Bombardier, which also announced that Google Inc Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette would join the board, were down 8.5 percent at C$4.83 in mid afternoon trading on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="38">Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial planemaker and Bombardier's closest rival, reported a 10 percent fall in quarterly profit on Thursday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Kenyan press outraged at controversial media law</seg>
<seg id="2">"It is a frightening place, and it is valid to ask: what is there to prevent Parliament from simply sweeping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow?" the paper said, challenging the bill as unconstitutional.</seg>
<seg id="3">"This law is draconian and very punitive and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, managing director for Capital Group - home to CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news websites.</seg>
<seg id="4">He said the new media tribunal "will always be biased because it's an extension of the government," and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's place in the global economy.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I hope the president will listen to us, and we appeal to him to reject this bill and return it to the MPs," he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will effectively hand the government "a stranglehold over the media," while The Standard said democracy and free speech in Kenya had been "dealt a major blow" and lambasted the bill as "draconian."</seg>
<seg id="7">The passing of the bill comes amid a string of measures to reinforce national security in the wake of the September's attack by Islamist gunmen on the Westgate shopping mall.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kenya media drew the ire of authorities by broadcasting security camera footage of troops who were dispatched to the scene of the attack purportedly robbing the upmarket mall.</seg>
<seg id="9">Police chief David Kimaiyo reacted by summoning two journalists and a media executive for questioning, although the summons was retracted following a media outcry.</seg>
<seg id="10">Under the new bill, media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million with the additional risk of being "de-listed," or barred from receiving official press accreditation.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tribunal also has the power to seize the property of an offender if a fine is not paid.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the Daily Nation, "even one fine is enough to cripple most FM stations."</seg>
<seg id="13">It also said the measures could have a devastating effect on what it described as Kenya's "lively blogosphere."</seg>
<seg id="14">By silencing the media, politicians know they can do whatever they like with impunity.</seg>
<seg id="15">"No one will ever know," wrote Nation journalist Mutuma Mathiu, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of checks and balances in public life.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Left to themselves, politicians would bankrupt the country and take us back to hunting and gathering," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="17">Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of public anger in the past.</seg>
<seg id="18">In May they voted to overturn cuts ordered by the national salaries commission and reinstate their hefty salaries of around 532,000 shillings a month tax-free - ranked among the highest in the world.</seg>

<seg id="1">Paul Hanlon rues missed Scottish League Cup chance</seg>
<seg id="2">DEFENDER Paul Hanlon believes Hibernian passed up a real chance to claim silverware this season after being dumped out of the Scottish League Cup by bitter rivals Hearts.</seg>
<seg id="3">Pat Fenlon's men dominated the opening spell at Easter Road and carved out a number of chances in a tie which they were regarded as favourites to win.</seg>
<seg id="4">But they were left stunned when Ryan Stevenson grabbed the only goal of the game to ensure the administration-hit Jambos would be the side drawn against Inverness in the last four.</seg>
<seg id="5">And, with both halves of the Old Firm already out of the competition, Hanlon admits the League Cup is a missed opportunity for Hibs.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said: "When Celtic go out, everyone looks at it and thinks they've got a chance this year."</seg>
<seg id="7">On another night we could have scored two or three goals and won the game comfortably.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was a wonder strike from their player and it has put us out of the cup.</seg>
<seg id="9">I think we were favourites and I think we showed that in our performance as well.</seg>
<seg id="10">We passed the ball better, kept the ball better and created the better chances but on the night the ball didn't go into the net.</seg>
<seg id="11">The cup exit marked the second Edinburgh derby defeat of the season so far to financially-stricken Hearts, who sit bottom of the Scottish Premiership having been docked 15 points for going into administration.</seg>
<seg id="12">And a crowd of angry Hibs fans gathered outside the stadium after the game to demand the removal of boss Fenlon.</seg>
<seg id="13">Hanlon said: "We want to send the supporters home happy."</seg>
<seg id="14">We tried our best.</seg>
<seg id="15">We created a number of chances but their keeper has produced great saves and kept the ball out.</seg>
<seg id="16">When you get beat, the fans are going to be disappointed but I think the level of performance was of a decent standard.</seg>
<seg id="17">We are just disappointed we are out of the cup.</seg>
<seg id="18">It's bitterly disappointing, especially with the number of chances we made in the game.</seg>
<seg id="19">I don't think we have made as many chances all season in all the games put together as we did in this game.</seg>
<seg id="20">We are just disappointed.</seg>
<seg id="21">Paul Heffernan has been in impressive form since his arrival at Hibs but the forward was cup-tied and forced to sit out the visit of Hearts.</seg>
<seg id="22">Asked if his absence led to a lack of cutting edge up front, Hanlon said: "It's hard to say."</seg>
<seg id="23">Paul has been great since he came in but I thought the lads were excellent, created chances and, on another night, we would have scored two or three goals.</seg>

<seg id="1">Tax on foreign property owners to burst London's bubble</seg>
<seg id="2">The Treasury have provisionally costed out the CGT measure but are awaiting a final decision from Mr Osborne, who, in the 2012 Budget, introduced a 7% rate of stamp duty for homes costing more than £2m and annual charges for buyers who choose to hold homes in a company rather than as individuals.</seg>
<seg id="3">Already the stamp duty take for residential property in the boroughs of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which stood at £708 million in the 2012/13 tax year, exceeds the combined total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, North West and Yorkshire and the Humber put together.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mr Cook said: "Following increases in stamp duty of high value homes and the introduction of associated anti-avoidance legislation, it is very difficult to argue that high value property is under-taxed irrespective of the effect of the out-dated council tax system."</seg>
<seg id="5">"But this move could make some foreign investors reticent to buy property in London or current owners reluctant to sell," he added.</seg>
<seg id="6">Prime property - the top 5% to 10% of the housing market by price - in the affluent south-west London belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has increased by a record 11.8% over the past year.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prices in central London continued to show steady year-on-year growth of 5.6% but were overshadowed by a burgeoning "domestic market" with the city's south west, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) all experiencing an uptick, according to research from Savills.</seg>

<seg id="89">The minister announced plans to probe into energy firms' accounts, to make them more transparent on profits and prices, as well as increasing penalties for market manipulation and regularly checking that the market is working.</seg>
<seg id="90">Davey said:</seg>
<seg id="91">The energy industry needs to change to put consumers in control.</seg>
<seg id="92">We want to push energy companies to make switching quicker and easier - because consumer action can force suppliers to change their ways.</seg>
<seg id="93">Bills are being redesigned through Ofgem's retail market reforms to give people the information they need to make switching easy - and we are taking direct action through the Big Energy Saving Network to bring first hand help to those vulnerable people who find switching difficult.</seg>
<seg id="94">Energy companies need to know that any wrongdoing will be uncovered and dealt with.</seg>
<seg id="95">That's why the regulators are going to carry out annual competition reviews, to make sure the energy market is operating properly.</seg>
<seg id="96">We are going to consult on increasing the sanctions for manipulation of the energy markets, so that they carry criminal penalties for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="97">Energy Secretary Ed Davey (l) and David Cameron (r) have both spoken out about the need for improved consumer protection in the energy market</seg>
<seg id="98">ECB could cut rates in December</seg>
<seg id="99">11.57 After the record high unemployment and the falling inflation, many analysts say there is now scope for tyhe European Central Bank to cut its main rate further from the already record low of 0.5pc.</seg>
<seg id="100">Most likely would be a 0.25 percentage point change.</seg>
<seg id="101">Ken Wattret, chief euro zone market economist at BNP Paribas, said:</seg>
<seg id="102">We see December as the most probable timing for a 25 basis points cut in the refi rate, in tandem with another round of low staff projections for inflation, including for 2015.</seg>
<seg id="103">Ben May, analyst at Capital Economics, said the ECB could provide support in the form of another round of LTRO - cheap financing for banks.</seg>
<seg id="104">The latest eurozone inflation and unemployment figures will increase pressure on the European Central Bank to take further action to support the economy.</seg>
<seg id="105">The ECB may soon provide further policy support, possibly in the form of another LTRO.</seg>
<seg id="106">Unemployment will remain high as businesses still not confident</seg>
<seg id="107">11.30 Marie Diron, senior economic adviser to the EY Eurozone Forecast, says a stable unemployment rate is as good as it gets for the eurozone at the moment and adds that she does not expect it to fall any time soon.</seg>
<seg id="108">Businesses are not yet confident enough about the growth outlook to switch to creating jobs, and there are some hurdles yet to go through which will prevent a significant decline in unemployment in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="109">In particular, the main priority now is to deal with the AQR and, in general, assessment and restructuring of banks' balance sheets.</seg>
<seg id="110">There is still some uncertainty on how this will be dealt with and what the implications for credit conditions and hence growth will be.</seg>
<seg id="111">Until this is cleared, job creation will be low at best and unemployment will remain high.</seg>
<seg id="112">BT topping the FTSE</seg>
<seg id="113">11.15 Back in the FTSE 100, well-received second quarter results have lifted shares in BT 1.7pc to the top of the blue-chip leaderboard.</seg>
<seg id="114">Insurer Resolution has also been buoyed by cash return hopes and has advanced 1.5pc.</seg>
<seg id="115">Analysts at Barclays, who raised the prospect of a capital return this morning, said:</seg>
<seg id="116">We believe Resolution will generate about £400m of cash in 2015, with incremental cash generation from management actions, the UK go to market operations and international offsetting the natural run-off of the back book.</seg>
<seg id="117">Furthermore, the strong cash generation may start to raise the question of whether the company can return its excess distributable capital, which we estimate could build to £450m over the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="118">It's a great time to join the euro</seg>
<seg id="119">10.57 The head of the eurozone finance ministers Jeroen Dijsselbloem has said that now is a great time to join the euro.</seg>
<seg id="120">The Dutch Finance Minister is in Latvia selling them the eurozone dream and says the euro area is picking up.</seg>

<seg id="128">Core inflation, which excludes prices of energy, food alcohol and tobacco slowed to 1.1pc year-on-year from 1.4pc in September.</seg>
<seg id="129">The very low inflation rate increases the chances that the ECB might consider another interest rate cut and has caused the euro to fall against the dollar.</seg>

<seg id="153">Mediobanca hints at Italian euro exit</seg>
<seg id="154">09.39 As Italy's unemployment hits a record high, Ambrose Evans-Pritchard has reported that Mediobanca, Italy's second biggest bank, has hinted at a euro exit unless Germany shifts ion EMU policy.</seg>
<seg id="155">Mediobanca is Italy's second biggest bank.</seg>
<seg id="156">It does not call for a withdrawal from EMU and a return to the lira, stocially accepting that discipline is the only way forward.</seg>
<seg id="157">Yet the logic of their Magnum Opus is that Italy would be far better off outside EMU, and the implicit threat is that Italy will have to do so if the Northern creditor powers persist with their destructive regime.</seg>
<seg id="158">Mediobanca says Italy economy's has 67pc "gearing" to the exchange rate due to the kinds of products it makes (price sensitive), compared with 40pc for Germany.</seg>
<seg id="159">Its latest report traces how Italy's productivity growth and competitiveness has faltered each time it pegged its currency to Germany over the past 40 years, and how it roared back with each devaluation.</seg>
<seg id="160">The report said EMU had allowed a "Chinese-like" Germany to lock in trade advantage, accumulating a surplus of €1.4 trillion, or 50pc of German GDP, and that this amounts to "a dangerous "beggar-thy-neighbour" zero-sum game for the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="161">It said Italy entered a "negative productivity spiral" only after it fixed the pre-EMU exchange rates in 1996.</seg>
<seg id="162">Refusing to acknowledge this "means denying the evidence."</seg>
<seg id="163">It accused the EU authorities of forcing the entire burden of post-crisis adjustment on the weaker Club Med states, of refusing to see the risk of a "negative recessionary spiral" in the South, or to see that these countries cannot stabilise their debt trajectories with a minimum of growth.</seg>
<seg id="164">The North must "meet the periphery halfway."</seg>
<seg id="165">Mediobanca's report added that the risk is a repetition of Argentina's fate as the dollar-peg fell apart in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="166">Italian unemployment hits record high</seg>
<seg id="167">09.22 Italy's unemployment rate hit a record high of 12.5pc in September.</seg>
<seg id="168">The figure was the highest since statistics office ISTAT's records began in 1977, and above expectations of 12.3pc.</seg>
<seg id="169">Italy's youth jobless rate also rose to a new record high at 40.4pc compared to 40.2 percent the month before.</seg>
<seg id="170">The overall employment rate fell to 55.4pc from 55.6pc in August.</seg>
<seg id="171">Unemployment has followed an upward trend since early 2011 as Italy has languished in its longest post-war recession.</seg>

<seg id="178">Three-piece suite falls victim to online revolution, says John Lewis</seg>
<seg id="179">08.55 John Lewis has given a unprecedented insight into consumer behaviour by revealing sales data.</seg>
<seg id="180">The three-piece suite, coloured jeans and table linens have fallen victim to the dramatic change in how families shop, according to one of the most detailed insights into the behaviour of British consumers.</seg>
<seg id="181">The research by the department store chain, which has analysed a year of sales data, shows that consumers are shopping morning, noon and night thanks to the revolution in digital technology.</seg>
<seg id="182">The John Lewis report, called How We Shop, Live & Look, also highlights a stark North-South divide in the tastes and behaviour of shoppers.</seg>
<seg id="183">For example, Welsh shoppers are 19pc more likely to buy red underwear, while sales of suspenders are 45pc above average in the North East, and shape and control underwear is 35pc higher in Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="184">In addition, shoppers in northern cites are using the internet differently to the South East.</seg>
<seg id="185">So while families in Liverpool, Edinburgh and Newcastle still find it convenient to drive to the high street to shop, online penetration is highest in the affluent London commuter belt, which includes cities such as St Albans, and the SW London postcode.</seg>

<seg id="269">Having taken their cues from this week's disappointing US economic data last night's FOMC decision to leave policy unchanged wasn't too much of a surprise to investors, given the likely economic damage from this month's government shutdown.</seg>
<seg id="270">What was a surprise though was the tone which was significantly less dovish than markets had expected, in the process sending markets lower as no mention was made of earlier concerns about tighter credit conditions, and higher interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="271">There was also no mention of the government shutdown with the tone evenly balanced between dovish and hawkish, in a way that in no way acknowledged that the shutdown had even occurred, and this appears to have caught the market off guard, given the recent and likely continued deterioration in the latest economic data.</seg>

<seg id="1">South Africa pose physical threat to Wales, says Rob Howley</seg>
<seg id="2">Six Nations champions Wales must prepare to face one of the most physical sides in world rugby when they play South Africa, says Rob Howley.</seg>
<seg id="3">Howley was at Ellis Park to watch New Zealand's 38-37 win over South Africa in Johannesburg on 5 October.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Wales assistant coach believes his side face a physical examination when they host the Springboks on 9 November.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We need the mental intensity and mental preparation to be ready for a week Saturday," said Howley.</seg>
<seg id="6">Having had the experience of going out to watch South Africa and New Zealand in Jo'burg... we are probably coming up against one of the most physical sides in world rugby.</seg>
<seg id="7">When you look at the performances of late in the Autumn series, we have been hugely disappointing.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this side played last it was against England and, I believe after that performance, we will have to go up another level to have any chance of beating the Springboks.</seg>
<seg id="9">Wales are the reigning 2013 Six Nations champions and had 10 players in the British and Irish Lions side which beat Australia 41-16 in the third Test to clinch the series 2-1 in July.</seg>
<seg id="10">Wales have only beaten South Africa once in the 26 meetings between the two countries, and that was the opening game at the Millennium Stadium in 1999.</seg>

<seg id="1">Assange didn't ask for consul meeting</seg>
<seg id="2">PRIME Minister Julia Gillard says WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has not sought face-to-face contact from Australian consular officials while his legal case has gone on.</seg>
<seg id="3">Mr Assange, who is now holed up in the Ecuadorean embassy in London seeking asylum, says he has not had personal contact with the Australian high commission in Britain since late 2010.</seg>
<seg id="4">Instead, contact had been limited to text messages asking 'Does Mr Assange have any concerns?'.</seg>
<seg id="5">Ms Gillard said in Rio de Janeiro, where she is attending a UN environment summit, that Mr Assange had received the same consular assistance as any other Australian would in the same situation.</seg>
<seg id="6">"In the course of these legal proceedings consular officials have been in contact with his legal team and Mr Assange has not requested or sought for those dealings to be directly with him," Ms Gillard said.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr Assange's "very high-powered legal team" was dealing with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="8">Consular officials had attended court for each day of proceedings, Ms Gillard said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Assange has said he is not prepared to go to Sweden under the terms he believed he would be held there.</seg>
<seg id="10">Swedish authorities want Mr Assange in Stockholm for questioning over sexual assault allegations against two women in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="11">He denies wrongdoing and argues that if extradited, Swedish authorities will hand him over to the United States, where the operations of WikiLeaks are under investigation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Swedes announced publicly that they would detain me, in prison, without charge while they continued their so-called investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr Assange told ABC Radio today.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Assange told the ABC he had mounted his bizarre request for political asylum in Ecuador because his native Australia had made an "effective declaration of abandonment" by refusing to intervene in his planned extradition from Britain to Sweden.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We had heard that the Ecuadoreans were sympathetic in relation to my struggles and the struggles of the organisation with the United States," Mr Assange said, explaining his actions in his first public comment since launching his asylum bid.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, Mr Assange acknowledged there was no guarantee that his plea would be successful, and indicated he didn't know when a decision on his case would be made.</seg>
<seg id="17">While inside Ecuador's London embassy, Mr Assange is out of the reach of British authorities.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, police are poised to pounce the moment he steps foot outside the building and have confirmed he will be arrested for breaching the terms of his bail, which include an overnight curfew at a registered address.</seg>

<seg id="1">Is Europe's elite ready to do business with Britain?</seg>
<seg id="2">Business for Britain launched in April with a pledge to bring business together and define what the UK's wealth and job creators want to see changed in our relationship with the EU.</seg>
<seg id="3">To that end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive poll of British business leaders asking them for their thoughts on Britain, business and the EU.</seg>
<seg id="4">YouGov polled over 1,000 business leaders, broadly representative of Britain's business sizes, sectors and regions.</seg>
<seg id="5">The conclusions of the poll will come as a surprise to many.</seg>
<seg id="6">We found that the vast majority of businesses are now looking to export outside of Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while the EU states stagnate.</seg>
<seg id="7">They want to see the Government prioritise new trading links with the likes of China, India and Brazil, rather than getting bogged down in the long and arduous process of reforming the EU's arcane institutions.</seg>
<seg id="8">When asked their views on specific policy areas - ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws - the majority of business leaders thought that control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster.</seg>
<seg id="9">There was general discontent with the Single Market, with businesses saying that the costs of Brussels regulation now outweighed the benefits of being part of Europe's trading area - even 40 per cent of large businesses, traditionally the most pro-European of companies, agreed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Finally, and most tellingly of all, our poll of business leaders found a clear majority wanted to see Britain pursue a course of treaty change and a relationship with the EU that is based on trade, not politics.</seg>
<seg id="11">This finding, which was reflected across the sizes and major business groups, shows that business is pushing for a "meaningful change" that brings powers back to the UK.</seg>
<seg id="12">The stakes are high - achieving treaty change and a better deal for Britain sees a 16 per cent swing towards voting to stay in the EU in a referendum.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Prime Minister should be in no doubt: this poll shows that British business backs his plan for renegotiating the terms of Britain's membership of the EU.</seg>
<seg id="14">It also shows that business expects that renegotiation to make a significant shift in the current balance of power back towards the UK.</seg>
<seg id="15">A better deal for British business is possible, and increasingly necessary as the eurozone embarks on the road to closer economic and fiscal union.</seg>
<seg id="16">The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and, as the findings of our poll show, for business this means a renewed focus on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels" regulatory approach.</seg>

<seg id="1">NSW teen's killers get max 45-year term</seg>
<seg id="2">Corey Loveridge and his teenaged accomplice have received one of the harshest sentences possible for the "cowardly, sadistic, pitiless and deadly attack" on a complete stranger.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 20-year-old and his co-offender, who can be identified only as AB because he was a juvenile at the time, were both given a maximum 45-year jail sentence, with a minimum 30-year non-parole term, for the random murder of 17-year-old Alan "Ray Ray" Gordon.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mr Gordon was stabbed in front of his brothers outside a service station in the western Sydney suburb of St Marys and had his Achilles tendon severed to stop him trying to kick them away.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was stabbed more than 40 times and died from massive blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="6">Justice Michael Adams described the 2011 murder as an "appalling crime" and a "cowardly, sadistic, pitiless and deadly attack."</seg>
<seg id="7">He said the men not only intended to kill their victim but also to torture him, causing him "excruciating pain."</seg>
<seg id="8">Loveridge, whose cousin Kieran Loveridge is awaiting sentencing for the manslaughter of Thomas Kelly in a separate Kings Cross king hit attack, was found guilty of murder by a jury in April.</seg>
<seg id="9">Justice Adams said the pair derived "unimaginable satisfaction or pleasure" from the murder.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said Loveridge had lied constantly and threatened witnesses, and that the pair show no remorse for what they had done.</seg>
<seg id="11">The two men were sat at opposite ends of the courtroom and had several Corrective Services officers around them after AB attacked Loveridge in a previous court appearance.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the victim's family began to clap after the sentences were handed down, Justice Adams stopped them, saying it was "a sad matter" and not a time for rejoicing.</seg>
<seg id="13">The pair's sentences also take into account a string of offences including the robbery and bashing of an elderly woman on the night of the murder.</seg>
<seg id="14">Alan's father, Ronald Hussey, told reporters outside the court that he couldn't ask for more than what had been handed down.</seg>
<seg id="15">My son was doing the same thing he did for years, which was to go down for his mother early in the morning to get her money out.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Hussey said his son's death had destroyed his family.</seg>
<seg id="17">He just started working; he just loved his job.</seg>
<seg id="18">He just never got a chance," Mr Hussey said.</seg>
<seg id="19">I no longer live at home.</seg>
<seg id="20">(His death) has pulled the family apart.</seg>
<seg id="21">The maximum sentence given to Loveridge and AB was nearly twice that handed down to another killer on Friday, in the next Supreme Court room.</seg>
<seg id="22">Sydney man Gavin Anthony Bell was jailed for a maximum 27 years and 10 months after he shot dead teenager Devril Leuthwaite in front of his family during a violent home invasion three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="23">Loveridge and AB will serve the same minimum sentence as teen killer Matthew Milat - a great-nephew of serial killer Ivan Milat - who pleaded guilty to murdering schoolmate David Auchterlonie.</seg>
<seg id="24">Milat was handed a maximum 43-year maximum term.</seg>

<seg id="1">It's a comeback in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who is staging "A Danse Danse", her two new group choreographies: the first inspired by the ink drawings and poems of Henri Michaux, the second inspired by the famous piano solos of Gymnopédies de Satie.</seg>
<seg id="2">This is an evening that showcases Chouinard's entire spectrum, from art to mannerisms and from the blackness of ink to whiteness.</seg>
<seg id="3">The background is a white screen.</seg>
<seg id="4">On the carpet, which is also white, in the immense space of the Théâtre Maisonneuve, a body appears, in profile, as thin as a line and dressed in black.</seg>
<seg id="5">An Henri Michaux ink drawing is projected onto the screen.</seg>
<seg id="6">The body, a simple stroke, takes its shape.</seg>
<seg id="7">And this shape is definitive of the entire piece: it is a series of physical representations of drawings.</seg>
<seg id="8">The dancers, all dressed in black, with only their hands and faces uncovered, wait on each side of the stage; they hurry on when the next graphic appears, incarnate it, then run off again.</seg>
<seg id="9">This Henri Michaux play with black and white is performed as a series of solos, in a group in unison (a mass acting as a solo), a large group of twelve solos, in which each individual makes a representation of their own sign.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is reminiscent of "Gloire du matin", wherein, in the form of solos, Chouinard delivers a series of choreographic tasks drawn on cartels and lined up at the front of the stage.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is the same principle in a giant PowerPoint version.</seg>
<seg id="12">In this performance, the music is loud,accompanied by percussion and electric guitars.</seg>
<seg id="13">The energy is great, and the rhythm fast.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is a break when Carol Prieur takes refuge under the dance mat, microphone in hand, to deliver, with no sobriety or reserve, part of a Michaux poem, in the flat monotonous voice of an auction, then continues to dance.</seg>
<seg id="15">The music starts again, and the sequence continues.</seg>
<seg id="16">This sustained (if that is possible) discharge of sound and energy ends up being deafening and numbing,</seg>
<seg id="17">as does the regularity of the visual rhythm.</seg>
<seg id="18">There are several beautiful flashes - the creation of images has always been one of Chouinard's strong points - like the hair that is ruffled or the black fabric that extends the lines.</seg>
<seg id="19">But the choreographic approach lacks composition.</seg>
<seg id="20">One gets the impression that, instead of going in search of Michaux's work, the choreographer has imposed herself on it with using her mannerisms.</seg>
<seg id="21">The result is bodies that seem flat in front of the drawings.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Michaux inks, like Gestalt shapes, provide a level of imagination broader and richer than dance, more porous.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only at the end, which is in negative, with the dancers broken up a strobe lights and becoming white symbols in a suddenly dark theatre, does it touch on magic.</seg>
<seg id="24">The audience liked it, the reception was warm.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the interval, the Gymnopédies is richer.</seg>
<seg id="26">The stage is partly draped in grey, the dancers and a piano are covered in fabric, like furniture in an abandoned house.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the piano, dancers take turns to play the scores.</seg>
<seg id="28">Their touching musical awkwardness shows real fragility.</seg>
<seg id="29">Couples cross the stage as pairs of lovers, very sensual, even erotic.</seg>
<seg id="30">Group work, small transiting solos, moving as a group, a chorus, makes the depiction less binary.</seg>
<seg id="31">Clowns appear, another regular feature of Chouinard's work, wearing red noses, in very polarised parades of male/female lovers.</seg>
<seg id="32">Their loves are toothy, evasive or playful.</seg>
<seg id="33">The body movements, the laughter, the small cries beautifully translate the archaicness, the gracefulness and the absurdity of bodies in coitus, of beings melting into each other.</seg>
<seg id="34">But the piece really takes off after the bow.</seg>
<seg id="35">A clown comes back on stage as the audience is leaving.</seg>
<seg id="36">At that point, anything goes: the fourth wall comes down, the explored universes are superimposed, the dancers ham it up, come down among the spectators, talk, smoke, pass through, play with the etiquette of applause, build up the hype amid a consciously calculated disorder that remains sensual.</seg>
<seg id="37">They exude joy and madness, and that is Chouinard's art; contaminating the audience.</seg>

<seg id="1">Essendon young gun Joe Daniher ready to test wings against GWS Giants</seg>
<seg id="2">Bombers coach James Hird is licking his lips at the prospect of the 201cm father-son selection dominating in the ruck and full-forward for the next decade.</seg>
<seg id="3">Essendon young gun Joe Daniher could be ready to make his debut.</seg>
<seg id="4">COMMON sense will probably prevail tomorrow given Joe Daniher, potentially, has a 15-year career ahead of him.</seg>
<seg id="5">After a rest last weekend, Essendon will probably get Daniher back in the VFL and let him make his AFL debut later in the year when he has truly earned it.</seg>
<seg id="6">But as Essendon begins to realise the biggest impediment to a deep run into September is the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority, imagine the possibilities of a Daniher debut against Greater Western Sydney on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="7">If Daniher is the extraordinary talent Essendon believes him to be, is it worth handing him an early debut?</seg>
<seg id="8">Twenty years on from the Baby Bombers, no one at Essendon needs reminding of just how valuable young players can be in a premiership surge.</seg>
<seg id="9">With key position Giants Phil Davis and Setanta O'hAilpin sidelined, the game is as close to a live kill as football gets.</seg>
<seg id="10">The virtual bye against GWS - the Bombers are $1.01 - is the perfect opportunity to ease Daniher into the action and give him a chance to shine.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would take something amazing for a 201cm tall to be a factor in his first season, but this kid has been rated the best TAC Cup graduate since Chris Judd.</seg>
<seg id="12">If the Dons give him a taste of the action, find he is out of his depth and warehouse him until later, what harm is done?</seg>
<seg id="13">But if Daniher can provide a real point of difference in a forward line already boasting Paddy Ryder, Michael Hurley, Stewart Crameri and Scott Gumbleton, the world is at his feet.</seg>
<seg id="14">In all likelihood the twin factors of his VFL rest last weekend and the returning stars will again push Daniher down the pecking order.</seg>
<seg id="15">Essendon says Hurley is right to go after overcoming ankle issues, and defenders Jake Carlisle and Dustin Fletcher are fit to play.</seg>
<seg id="16">Carlisle has been cleared of structural damage to his ankle but, as with Hurley and Fletcher, why play the trio when another week of rest prepares them for a five-week stretch that includes Geelong, Brisbane Lions, Richmond, Sydney at the SCG and Carlton?</seg>
<seg id="17">Informed wisdom says Daniher won't play but, as the wily old fox Kevin Sheedy said so often at Windy Hill, too often we think why rather than why not.</seg>

<seg id="1">Rich New Yorkers have nothing to fear from de Blasio</seg>
<seg id="2">The Democratic mayoral candidate's plan to raise taxes will not provoke a flight from New York</seg>
<seg id="3">For several months Bill de Blasio has been describing New York in the era of mayor Michael Bloomberg as "a tale of two cities."</seg>
<seg id="4">He should hope so.</seg>
<seg id="5">In polls leading up to Tuesday's election, Mr de Blasio, the Democratic party candidate to replace Mr Bloomberg, leads his Republican opponent by 68 per cent to 23 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="6">If there are two New Yorks, he occupies the bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="7">The city, Mr de Blasio believes, wrongly favours its rich millionaires over its poor millions.</seg>
<seg id="8">As New York's public advocate, the city's elected watchdog, he claims to speak for the latter.</seg>
<seg id="9">His leftist platform includes cracking down on police searches, raising taxes on top earners, extending day care and maybe ending Central Park horse-and-carriage rides in the name of animal rights.</seg>
<seg id="10">Christopher Caldwell</seg>
<seg id="11">Joe Lhota, the Republican candidate, warns that this would return the city to the mess it was in two decades ago.</seg>
<seg id="12">The administration of David Dinkins - then mayor, to whom Mr de Blasio was an aide - was marked by penury, crime and race riots.</seg>
<seg id="13">In Mr Lhota's view, the most productive citizens will soon be so fearful of being robbed by tax collectors on the one hand and muggers on the other that they will take their talents elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="14">That will not happen, even if Mr de Blasio winds up being as radical a mayor as some fear.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr de Blasio has described his world view to New York magazine as a mix of Franklin Roosevelt, European social democracy and liberation theology.</seg>
<seg id="16">The child of activists investigated for communist ties in the 1950s, he supported Nicaragua's Sandinistas in the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="17">He loves rent control, distrusts publicly funded, privately run "charter" schools, and works closely with the Working Families party, the political arm of the city's unions.</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr de Blasio won the Democrats" nod with a stroke of political inspiration.</seg>
<seg id="19">He sensed a public resentment of Mr Bloomberg before it showed in opinion polls, and turned himself into the mayor's most visible foe.</seg>
<seg id="20">Stop-and-frisk, a policy that authorises police to question people and check them for weapons, was a perfect issue for him.</seg>
<seg id="21">The policy is credited with helping cut street crime, and has generally passed constitutional muster, despite continuing controversy.</seg>
<seg id="22">But under Mr Bloomberg, police were asked to tally their stop-and-frisk arrests in a way that hinted at an incentive system or quota.</seg>
<seg id="23">Those detained felt subject to arbitrary justice.</seg>
<seg id="24">Policing aside, Mr de Blasio would be more like his predecessor than meets the eye.</seg>
<seg id="25">While his tax on high earners sounds anti-business in principle, it is likely to be a non-event in practice.</seg>
<seg id="26">It would raise the marginal rate on those earning more than $500,000 a year from 3.9 per cent to 4.4 per cent, and even then would require a vote of the state legislature and the signature of the state governor to take effect.</seg>
<seg id="27">Until that happens Mr de Blasio can have the best of both worlds.</seg>
<seg id="28">He can push for crèches for needy families without having to raise taxes on his wealthier supporters.</seg>
<seg id="29">If Mr de Blasio faces big political and economic risks in the next couple of years, they will not arise from his programme.</seg>
<seg id="30">President Barack Obama's healthcare plan requires significant adjustments, which will be expensive if they can be managed and damaging to Mr de Blasio's Democratic party if they cannot.</seg>
<seg id="31">An end to the US Federal Reserve's quantitative easing programme, or even a tapering of its asset purchases, could play havoc with city tax revenues.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is true that capital is more portable than a quarter of a century ago, when Mr Dinkins ran for mayor.</seg>
<seg id="33">Back then, there was a clear logic to having banks located in the same city as the stock exchange and the headquarters of the industrial corporations whose commercial paper the banks dealt.</seg>
<seg id="34">That logic is weaker now that bankers spend more time designing derivatives, lobbying Congress and helping debtor countries navigate EU budgetary criteria.</seg>
<seg id="35">But just because capital can move does not mean it will.</seg>
<seg id="36">It would be hard to set the opportunity cost of leaving the city, but it probably takes more to get someone to move from New York to Houston than from, say, Phoenix to Houston.</seg>
<seg id="37">Half a percentage point on the taxes of about 40,000 rich New Yorkers sounds far too low to provoke a rush to the exits.</seg>
<seg id="38">If you move, do not expect to replace that former member of the Vienna Philharmonic who is teaching your daughter the oboe, your jogging route around the Central Park reservoir or your sake-tasting club.</seg>
<seg id="39">New York is just different.</seg>
<seg id="40">It is politically different, too.</seg>
<seg id="41">Ed Koch served three terms as mayor of New York.</seg>
<seg id="42">But he lost his race for state governor in 1982 after he confided to a Playboy interviewer that he thought life in the rural parts of the state was "a joke."</seg>
<seg id="43">For a New York governor, that would be a terrible gaffe.</seg>
<seg id="44">For a New York mayor, it is a governing philosophy.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clive Palmer claims PM Tony Abbott has conflict of interest over parental leave scheme</seg>
<seg id="2">Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over his parental leave scheme because his daughters might get pregnant and benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="3">The mining magnate, who is in a dispute about paying a $6 million carbon tax bill, made the claim as he tried to brush off questions about whether he had a conflict.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate that may be crucial in deciding if the carbon and mining taxes are axed.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Mr Palmer claimed it was only ministers who could have a conflict of interest and said Mr Abbott's daughters stood to personally benefit from policies.</seg>
<seg id="6">"He's got a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave because if any of those daughters get pregnant, he'll have a direct interest whether they get leave or not," Mr Palmer said.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two months after the election, the electoral commission officially declared Mr Palmer the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax by 53 votes, after a recount.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr Palmer called for overhaul of election counting to speed up the process.</seg>
<seg id="9">Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.</seg>
<seg id="10">Should this election be decided two months after we stopped voting?</seg>
<seg id="11">"We need to have a better system," he said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Why is it that we shouldn't have a system where you can walk in, punch your details into a computer, vote immediately and have a result at 6.30 that night?</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr Palmer also criticised the use of pencils to mark ballots.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is it because they can rub out the result if someone doesn't like it?</seg>
<seg id="15">In this day and age having a pencil seems extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Electoral Commission has been studying options for electronic voting and recently released a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.</seg>

<seg id="1">Beckham back training at Manchester United, but a return for David is unlikely as son Brooklyn trains with academy</seg>
<seg id="2">Old Trafford could soon be cheering on Beckham once again after he took part in a training session yesterday at Manchester United's Carrington training base.</seg>
<seg id="3">But despite former England captain David attending the session, it was his eldest son Brooklyn that was doing all the impressing as he joined in with some of the academy players at the club.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 14-year-old has previously been a part of the LA Galaxy academy as well as training with Chelsea before he joined the Queens Park Rangers youth set-up.</seg>
<seg id="5">Despite no confirmation from the reigning Premier League champions that Beckham had been taken on an official trial, it is believed that he will be invited back to train again as they look to secure one of the biggest names in football - albeit thanks to his father's legacy.</seg>
<seg id="6">The former right midfielder made nearly 400 appearances for the Red Devils having been part of the golden generation of the 1992 FA Youth Cup-winning team, which also featured club greats such as the Paul Scholes, Gary and Phil Neville and Nicky Butt.</seg>
<seg id="7">Although Beckham had a long relationship with United, which saw him lift six Premier League trophies as well as two FA Cups and the Champions League success of 1999, his 12-year-old son has been training with rivals Arsenal in recent months, as well as watching the first team play from the Emirates Stadium stands.</seg>
<seg id="8">Meanwhile, Beckham senior has been hitting the headlines this week as he looks set to push forward plans to start-up his own Major League Soccer franchise, with Miami reported to be his favoured destination.</seg>
<seg id="9">Beckham, who retired from professional football in the summer after a final short-term spell with Paris St-Germain, has a clause in his LA Galaxy contract that allowed him the option of starting up his own franchise once he ended his career for a £15.5m fee - much cheaper than the going rate required to start a team in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="10">Brooklyn has trained with members of the PSG squad during his father's spell with the club, as seen her with him taking on defender Thiago Silva</seg>
<seg id="11">David took his son's Romeo (L) and Cruz (R) to the Emirates to watch Arsenal earlier this season after Romeo has been training with their academy</seg>

<seg id="2">The grandmother apparently lit a cigarette while there was a gas leak,</seg>
<seg id="3">leading to an explosion in a house in Gesves that left two people seriously injured on Friday morning - the 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson. The explosion was caused by a gas leak in a faulty water heater, the assistant public prosecutor said on Friday evening.</seg>
<seg id="4">The expert, who was dispatched to the scene by the public prosecutor's office, stated that the cause of the explosion was purely accidental.</seg>
<seg id="5">The grandmother lit a cigarette when there was a gas leak and a build-up of gas.</seg>
<seg id="6">The condition of the two victims remains critical.</seg>
<seg id="7">The grandmother was thrown across the room by the explosion and seriously burnt.</seg>
<seg id="8">The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and partner, was by her side and suffered less serious burns.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The two victims were intubated and treated for some time at the site, before being taken to the CHU in Liège, by helicopter and by ambulance for the grandmother and her grandson respectively," said Mayor José Paulet on visiting the site.</seg>
<seg id="10">The traumatised grandfather was upstairs at the time of the explosion.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was unhurt and, thus, able to go downstairs using the staircase which had remained intact, though the rear wall of the house was completely destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="12">The grandfather and the tenant of the house next door, which was weakened by the explosion, have been accommodated elsewhere by the head of the social services.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Andenne and Namur fire departments and the police from Arches intervened.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Crisnée civil protection services has stabilised the two buildings.</seg>

<seg id="1">Parents of Georgia teen who died in 'freak accident' believe son was murdered</seg>
<seg id="2">The parents of a Georgia teenager, whose body was found inside a rolled-up wrestling mat in his high school gym, believe their son was murdered, the family's attorney said Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendrick Johnson, of Valdosta, Ga., was found Jan. 11 stuck in an upright mat propped behind the bleachers inside his high school gym.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lowndes County sheriff's investigators concluded Johnson died in a freak accident, but the 17-year-old's family disputes that.</seg>
<seg id="5">"They absolutely think their son was murdered," Benjamin Crump, an attorney representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.</seg>
<seg id="6">They never believed he died the way the sheriff concluded.</seg>
<seg id="7">"They believe that it defies logic, the laws of physics as well as common sense," Crump said.</seg>
<seg id="8">They think this is a cover-up to protect the person or people responsible for their son's death.</seg>
<seg id="9">"They sent their son to school with a book-bag and he was returned to them in a body bag," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday he is conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remain unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="11">What was the cause of death?</seg>
<seg id="12">Was his death the result of a crime?</seg>
<seg id="13">Moore said at a press conference Thursday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="14">I will follow the facts wherever they lead.</seg>
<seg id="15">My objective is to discovery the truth.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I am of the opinion that a sufficient basis exists" for a formal investigation, he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicated Johnson died as a result of "positional asphyxia."</seg>
<seg id="18">A second autopsy, however, listed a different cause of death, according to Moore.</seg>
<seg id="19">"There are several questions that must be answered or confirmed," he said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Moore added that if he uncovers sufficient evidence to warrant a criminal or civil rights investigation into the death of Johnson he will ask the FBI to conduct it.</seg>
<seg id="21">A representative from the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office was not immediately available for comment when contacted Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="22">A southern Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered authorities to release all surveillance video that investigators reviewed.</seg>
<seg id="23">The teenager's parents said they hope the video footage will contain clues to how he died.</seg>

<seg id="1">Cristiano Ronaldo forced to go it alone in pursuit of greatness at Real Madrid</seg>
<seg id="2">The second great wave of galáctico-buying brought to the Bernabéu not only Figo and Zidane but the Brazilian Ronaldo and David Beckham.</seg>
<seg id="3">Roberto Carlos was already there, as was Raúl, who took 16 years to reach a club-record 228 league goals (Ronaldo has totted up 158 since 2009).</seg>
<seg id="4">Manchester United's replacement for Beckham has accumulated goals mightily and relentlessly, in the shadow of a Barcelona side commonly described as the finest club team in history, and one constructed for the benefit of Ronaldo's only serious rival in world football: Lionel Messi.</seg>
<seg id="5">Old pros often ask the question: if you placed Messi in this Real Madrid starting XI, would he be quite as good?</seg>
<seg id="6">And if Ronaldo was transferred to Barcelona, would he inflict even more havoc with his bustling counter-attacking style, impeccable professionalism and sadistic finishing?</seg>
<seg id="7">All we know is that Ronaldo has done it the hard way.</seg>
<seg id="8">Conspicuous Consumption Era No 1 for President Florentino Pérez also found room for Thomas Gravesen and Jonathan Woodgate; but there is simply no comparison between the job spec handed to Zidane and Figo and the one carried out so conscientiously by Ronaldo, who mocked Blatter's harmless "commander" remark by military saluting each time he scored against Sevilla.</seg>
<seg id="9">History tells us Ronaldo likes to have something to kick against: brutish full-backs and Ruud van Nistelrooy in England, Messi and now Blatter in Spain.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bale, you feel, is another provocation he will welcome.</seg>
<seg id="11">A charitable team-mate might have allowed the young newbie from Wales to take the penalty for Real's third goal to complete his hat-trick.</seg>
<seg id="12">No way.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ronaldo slapped it in on the way to his own three-timer.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sometimes the game throws up a great player who perpetually looks as if he is trying to prove a point.</seg>
<seg id="15">Ronaldo has that stamp.</seg>
<seg id="16">A point we all should concede is that he has carried this second Pérez-funded Real side for much of his four years at the Bernabéu.</seg>
<seg id="17">Raúl, who won six La Liga titles and three Champions League crowns, was the beneficiary of symphonic attacking football, orchestrated by Zidane.</seg>
<seg id="18">In that period Real were set up as an entertainment troupe.</seg>
<seg id="19">The team embellished by Ronaldo are more modestly constructed.</seg>
<seg id="20">Luka Modric, Sami Khedira and Karim Benzema are classy types, but from the Pep Guardiola era onwards Madrid have struggled to cope with the Barcelona of Messi, Xavi, Andrés Iniesta and now Neymar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The pincer of Ronaldo and Bale will crush many opponents.</seg>
<seg id="22">But however well Bale adapts to the circus life of the Bernabéu it remains hard to imagine him surpassing the stratospheric levels of Ronaldo, a marvel of self-improvement who taught himself first to dazzle and then to dominate.</seg>
<seg id="23">His physical transformation from trickster to terror has been the most impressive personal leap of the last 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">His brilliance is attached these days to a bulldozer.</seg>
<seg id="25">Messi, on the other hand, is an older, more mature version of the boy-genius you see in his family's early videos.</seg>
<seg id="26">The essence of his game has not altered.</seg>
<seg id="27">At United, then in Spain, Ronaldo became the player Blatter tried to describe with his military analogy.</seg>
<seg id="28">The best Real Madrid sides have been collections of world-beaters.</seg>
<seg id="29">This one rely on the consistent, pummelling power of a counter-striker who is adept with both feet, heads the ball like an English centre-half and decided, somewhere inside, that he will just have to go it alone if his team-mates cannot join him on his supremely high level.</seg>
<seg id="30">Can Bale?</seg>
<seg id="31">Could anyone?</seg>

<seg id="4">PICTURES and footage of a drug smuggling "super tunnel" have been released as authorities reveal more about the "hi-tech" passageway.</seg>
<seg id="5">Designed to smuggle drugs from Tijuana, Mexico, to San Diego was equipped with lighting, ventilation and an electric rail system, U.S. authorities said, making it one of the most sophisticated secret passages discovered along the U.S.-Mexico border.</seg>
<seg id="6">Authorities seized 8 1/2 tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the tunnel's discovery, according to court records.</seg>
<seg id="7">Three men who authorities say worked as drivers were charged Thursday with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to distribute.</seg>
<seg id="8">U.S. Attorney Laura Duffy said they face prison sentences between 10 years and life if convicted.</seg>
<seg id="9">The tunnel, which zigzags the length of nearly six football fields, links warehouses in Tijuana and San Diego's Otay Mesa industrial area.</seg>
<seg id="10">The area is filled with nondescript warehouses, making it easier to conceal trucks being loaded with drugs.</seg>
<seg id="11">U.S. officials release video showing cross border tunnel between the United States and Mexico in which large stashes of cocaine and marijuana were confiscated.</seg>
<seg id="12">Roselle Chen reports.</seg>
<seg id="13">The tunnel was shut down Wednesday night, before any drugs made it through undetected, authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Federal agents had the San Diego warehouse under surveillance after being tipped off by an informant who told them that operators bought drills and other construction equipment in August and September.</seg>
<seg id="15">As U.S. border security has heightened on land, Mexican drug cartels have turned to ultralight aircraft, small fishing boats and tunnels.</seg>
<seg id="16">More than 75 underground passages have been discovered along the border since 2008, designed largely to smuggle marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="17">The "super tunnel" linked warehouses in Tijuana and San Diego to smuggle drugs.</seg>
<seg id="18">Picture: AP Photo/U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Source: AP</seg>
<seg id="19">The tunnels are concentrated along the border in California and Arizona.</seg>
<seg id="20">San Diego is popular because its claylike soil is easy to dig.</seg>
<seg id="21">In Nogales, Ariz., smugglers tap into vast underground drainage canals.</seg>
<seg id="22">The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006, a period during which Mexico's Sinaloa cartel has solidified its hold on the prized smuggling corridor.</seg>
<seg id="23">Authorities said Wednesday's tunnel was the first in the San Diego area that was found to be used for cocaine.</seg>
<seg id="24">U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents with bales of some of the more than eight tons of marijuana and cocaine seized from the tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="25">The passage was about 35 feet underground, 4 feet high and 3 feet wide, said Derek Benner, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's head of Homeland Security Investigations in San Diego.</seg>
<seg id="26">Authorities said the zigzag route suggests that excavators veered off course several times.</seg>
<seg id="27">Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered after central Mexico's marijuana harvest in October, which presents drug cartels with a challenge of how to quickly get their product to consumers.</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the 8 1/2 tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine authorities seized in connection with the tunnel's discovery.</seg>
<seg id="29">In November 2011, authorities found a 600-yard tunnel that resulted in seizures of 32 tons of marijuana on both sides of the border, with 26 tons found on the U.S. side, accounting for one of the largest pot busts in U.S. history.</seg>
<seg id="30">The tunnel was equipped with electric rail cars, lighting and ventilation.</seg>
<seg id="31">Wooden planks lined the floor.</seg>
<seg id="32">On Thanksgiving Day 2010, authorities found a roughly 700-yard passage equipped with rail tracks that extended from the kitchen of a Tijuana home to two San Diego warehouses, netting about 22 tons of marijuana on both sides of the border.</seg>
<seg id="33">Agents inspect some of the drugs seized from the tunnel, equipped with electricity, ventilation and a rail system.</seg>
<seg id="34">Seizures linked to the tunnel include a haul of 3 tons of marijuana in a truck that was stopped by Chula Vista police on Saturday for a traffic violation and 5 1/2 tons of marijuana inside the tunnel, a nearby warehouse and a truck Wednesday, according to prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="35">The cocaine was found in six suitcases inside a van seen leaving the warehouse Wednesday.</seg>

<seg id="2">Aiming to curb unhealthy consumption habits, Mexico's Congress on Thursday approved new taxes on sugary drinks and junk food.</seg>
<seg id="3">Lawmakers approved a tax of one peso per liter, or about 8 cents, on soft drinks and an 8 percent sales tax on high-calorie foods, including potato chips, sweets and cereal.</seg>
<seg id="4">President Enrique Peña Nieto is expected to sign the taxes into law in January.</seg>
<seg id="5">The soft drink and food industries lobbied heavily to defeat the plan, but lawmakers said it was necessary to reduce rising rates of obesity and diabetes, as well as to raise revenue.</seg>
<seg id="6">Almost 70 percent of Mexicans are overweight, and about a third are obese, according to the World Health Organization.</seg>
<seg id="7">The foundation of New York City's mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, financed an ad campaign to support the so-called soda tax.</seg>

<seg id="2">Ashley Ratcliff has received awards for his exploration of alternative heat-loving grape varieties.</seg>
<seg id="3">Picture: Michael Marshall Source: News Limited</seg>
<seg id="4">IT'S been a very good year for Ashley Ratcliff.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Barossa-based viticulturist manages Yalumba's extensive vineyard in South Australia's Riverland region, and in the past couple of months he's won three major awards for his groundbreaking way with grapevines.</seg>
<seg id="6">The gongs started coming in September when Ashley was named Horticultural Grower of the Year by ABC Rural.</seg>
<seg id="7">A few days later he picked up the Wine Industry Award at the Riverland Wine Show - an award normally given to winemakers.</seg>
<seg id="8">And last week he was named Viticulturist of the Year by the prestigious Australian Society of Viticulture and Oenology.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's about bloody time hard-working viticulturists such as Ashley received this kind of public recognition.</seg>
<seg id="10">The winemakers usually take all the credit in this industry - but without talented people growing quality grapes, there's no wine at all.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ashley's awards are for his exploration of alternative, heat-loving grape varieties and his involvement, as founding chairman, with the Riverland Alternative Wine group, set up a few years ago to share information about these exciting new-to-the-region grapes.</seg>
<seg id="12">As well as working for Yalumba, he and wife Holly also have their own 40ha Riverland vineyard called Ricca Terra at Barmera, where they have planted southern Italian grapes such as vermentino, nero d'avola and grillo on drought-tolerant rootstocks and are growing them with much less irrigation and at lower yields than are common in this hot, thirsty country.</seg>
<seg id="13">Literally putting their money where his mouth is.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ashley sells all the grapes from his own vineyard, mostly to large wineries in the region such as his bosses at Yalumba, to Angoves and Salena Estate.</seg>
<seg id="15">But this last vintage, 2013, he also sold some of the red nero d'avola grapes to two very small wineries a long way away: Bellwether Wines all the way down in Coonawarra and Wine by Brad all the way over in Margaret River.</seg>
<seg id="16">It's a fascinating exercise to taste them side-by-side: two completely different end results from the same raw materials.</seg>
<seg id="17">The 2013 Bellwether Nero d'Avola Rose (about $25) is the palest of pale salmon in colour but packs a mighty punch of flavour, with the juicy crisp crunch of a slightly unripe strawberry and the savoury, creamy texture of a full-bodied dry white wine.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 2013 Vino Amato Nero d'Avola ($30) from Wine by Brad, by contrast, is a bright purple-coloured, medium-bodied snappy young red lovely dark fruit and an easy manner - exactly the kind of red you want to drink, slightly chilled, on a hot summer's evening, with pizza.</seg>
<seg id="19">I've spent a lot of time talking to Ashley over the years about his visions for the Riverland - visions that have been realised with wines such as these two.</seg>
<seg id="20">And I've watched as his impressive leadership skills and extraordinary energy have helped instil a sense of optimism and pride in the region's growers and producers, despite the wine industry as a whole going through one of its toughest periods.</seg>
<seg id="21">I'm not surprised in the slightest he's won all these awards.</seg>

<seg id="1">Michael Souter jailed for 22 years for abusing boys</seg>
<seg id="2">A former BBC radio presenter has been jailed for 22 years for a string of sexual offences against children that spanned 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Michael Souter, who previously worked at Radio Clyde, was found guilty of 26 offences including indecent assault and possessing indecent images of children.</seg>
<seg id="4">Norfolk Police said the Scot was responsible for "one of the worst cases of prolonged child abuse" their officers had ever dealt with.</seg>
<seg id="5">Detective Inspector Paul Brown said the "Savile effect" had encouraged more victims of high-profile sex offenders to speak out.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said: "While I wouldn't compare Souter and [Jimmy] Savile directly, both used their celebrity to cultivate a certain respectable image and both cases have served to highlight that social attitudes are changing and child abuse will be investigated rigorously by police.</seg>
<seg id="7">We have certainly seen an increase in people coming forward and hopefully convictions like this can continue to give people the confidence to do so.</seg>
<seg id="8">Souter's victims packed the courtroom at Norwich Crown Court to hear Judge Mark Lucraft QC pass sentence.</seg>
<seg id="9">The judge said Souter was a "predatory paedophile" with an "ongoing sexual obsession with boys."</seg>
<seg id="10">He said: "The childhood of many of your victims was destroyed and their lives blighted."</seg>
<seg id="11">You exploited your position to groom each of them.</seg>
<seg id="12">""You took hundreds of photographs of boys in shorts and were the only person in this court who could not see these pictures for what they were.""</seg>
<seg id="13">Souter had claimed that his victims fabricated the allegations against him and accused police of planting indecent images on his computer after he was arrested in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="14">"But Judge Lucraft dismissed his claims as "pathetic."</seg>
<seg id="15">A jury of nine men and three women took around three hours to find Soutar guilty at the end of a five-week trial.</seg>
<seg id="16">He had denied 19 charges of indecent assault, indecency with a child and serious sexual offences, against seven boys aged between 11 and 16.</seg>
<seg id="17">The offences dated from 1979 to 1999.</seg>
<seg id="18">He was also found guilty of seven counts of making and possessing indecent images of children which were found on his computer.</seg>
<seg id="19">He was banned from working with children indefinitely ordered to to pay legal costs of £14,694 and may be forced to sell properties in the UK and abroad, the court heard.</seg>
<seg id="20">Souter's catalogue of abuse began in 1979 when he worked at BBC Radio Norfolk.</seg>
<seg id="21">During the 1980s and 1990s his abuse escalated as he took up senior positions within the community, including as a Scout leader and social services youth mentor.</seg>
<seg id="22">Two of the boys were "repeatedly abused" over five years.</seg>
<seg id="23">Souter had previously been arrested in 1993 when one boy made a complaint of abuse, but no further action was taken against him then or in 2002, when two further complaints were made.</seg>
<seg id="24">It was only in 2010, when police received another complaint from a man who gave details of other victims, that a full investigation was launched.</seg>

<seg id="1">i Editor's Letter: Cameras in court</seg>
<seg id="2">Only one in every 36 pound coins in circulation is fake, according to the Royal Mint - but in London it's much higher than that, you'll find two or three in a fistful of change.</seg>
<seg id="3">One of the cretins responsible for this corruption of our currency made history yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="4">Kevin Fisher from Goffs Oak, Herts, was the first to have his case televised live from court (page 9).</seg>
<seg id="5">He's serving seven years for counterfeiting and was appealing his sentence.</seg>
<seg id="6">Unsuccessfully, it turned out.</seg>
<seg id="7">His QC, Alex Cameron, brother of our PM, became the first barrister to broadcast from inside an English courtroom after the 88-year ban on photography was lifted.</seg>
<seg id="8">Consideration is now being given to allowing cameras into criminal courts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Hello, 20th century!</seg>
<seg id="10">We have been able to see justice being done all over the world, but not at home.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some in our judiciary oppose televised proceedings, fearing that broadcasters will gravitate towards the salacious and the gruesome, that lawyers and witnesses (and, dare we suggest it, a few judges) will showboat in pursuit of a television spectacle inconducive to justice.</seg>
<seg id="12">But yesterday's network premiere was, in the end, a dull affair, more typical of daily court life than the Judge Judy slapstick which we are accustomed to seeing on the box.</seg>
<seg id="13">While court cases must not become a new form of reality telly, it is within the boundaries of the human imagination to set rules that might allow the broadcasting of (say) judges" summing-up and barristers" opening and closing statements - thus protecting the anonymity of victims, witnesses and jurors, and sparing cross-examination further theatrics.</seg>
<seg id="14">After TV, how about the internet?</seg>
<seg id="15">It's taken the English judiciary 85 years since the first telly broadcast to let this wizard invention be used in court.</seg>
<seg id="16">So we can expect accurate, searchable court listings to be made available to the public online in 2076.</seg>

<seg id="2">Cardiff City's new head of recruitment, Alisher Apsalyamov, is under investigation by the Home Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is understood the 23-year-old Kazakh has been told he will not work for the Barclays Premier League club while the Home Office investigates his work permit situation.</seg>
<seg id="4">Apsalyamov, a friend of the son of club owner Vincent Tan, replaced Iain Moody in a move that cast doubt over manager Malky Mackay's long-term future at the Cardiff City Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="5">Reports yesterday suggested Apsalyamov had been asked to step down from the role but it is understood that, while he is not currently operating for the club in an official capacity, he retains the position while his visa documentation is assessed.</seg>
<seg id="6">Moody - a long-time collaborator with Scottish coach Mackay, who helped recruit players including Gary Medel and Stephen Caulker in the summer - was initially suspended by the club before Apsalyamov was installed in his post on Oct 9.</seg>
<seg id="7">After talks with the Cardiff board, Mackay rejected suggestions he was preparing to resign and reaffirmed his commitment to the Welsh club.</seg>
<seg id="8">Meanwhile the Football Association has charged Cardiff and Norwich City with "failing to ensure their players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion" following the incidents at the end of last weekend's goalless draw at Carrow Road.</seg>
<seg id="9">A scuffle ensued after Norwich's Leroy Fer put the ball in the net when Cardiff expected he would return it to them after an injury.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Both Norwich City and Cardiff City have been charged by the FA for failing to ensure their players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion," the statement read.</seg>
<seg id="11">Both clubs have until 6pm on Nov 4 to respond to the charge.</seg>

<seg id="1">An Obama voter's cry of despair</seg>
<seg id="2">I voted for President Obama twice, sharing hope in possibility of change</seg>
<seg id="3">He says Obama has had worthy efforts thwarted by GOP obstructionism</seg>
<seg id="4">Obstructionism can't excuse Obamacare website woes, drone attacks</seg>
<seg id="5">Obama's 2008 campaign memoir is a sad reminder of what might have been</seg>
<seg id="6">Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.</seg>
<seg id="7">I'm reading a terribly sad book these days.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's a book that I thought would uplift me during the doldrums of second-year medical school, and renew in me a sense of hope.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's called "The Audacity to Win," and it's a memoir of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="10">When I'm finished with my patient write-ups at night and get into bed, the book returns me to a time when politics inspired millions and speeches could take your breath away.</seg>
<seg id="11">The election turned out to be a landslide, and news anchors paused to reflect on the historic nature of the hour.</seg>
<seg id="12">My classmates cried with joy, and my parents saved every newspaper they could find.</seg>
<seg id="13">A young team of visionaries was headed for the White House, and the nation was ready for change.</seg>
<seg id="14">During Obama's transition to office in 2008, he had an 82% approval rating.</seg>
<seg id="15">And then I close the book.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cutting to the present is a rude awakening, like snapping out of a dream.</seg>
<seg id="17">It's hard to remember those days of optimism -- they seem a distant memory, a sad reminder of opportunities gone by.</seg>
<seg id="18">Change indeed happened, in the years since I cast my first ballot.</seg>
<seg id="19">It was simply nothing I could have imagined.</seg>
<seg id="20">I credit Obama with great and varied accomplishments, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to our military exit from Iraq, the end of "don't ask don't tell," to the killing of Osama bin Laden.</seg>
<seg id="21">Moreover, I believe that partisan obstructionism has upended too many efforts to push our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health care, and closing the base at Guantanamo Bay, among others.</seg>
<seg id="22">But, after the countless times in which I have found myself defending the Obama administration to colleagues and peers, I've reached a limit to the explanations that I can provide.</seg>
<seg id="23">I've reached a point of political despair.</seg>
<seg id="24">Republican obstructionism cannot explain allowing the bugging of foreign leaders, nor having drones strike innocent children overseas.</seg>
<seg id="25">It cannot explain having the National Security Agency collect data on the private lives of Americans, nor prosecuting whistle-blowers who reveal government wrongdoing.</seg>
<seg id="26">It cannot account for assassinating Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without a trial, nor shirking public funding and spending limits during presidential campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="27">It cannot justify the findings of a report that says the White House's efforts to silence the media are the "most aggressive ... since the Nixon Administration."</seg>
<seg id="28">And, most recently, it cannot excuse the failure to design a simple website more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law.</seg>
<seg id="29">I don't know if this is what I should have expected.</seg>
<seg id="30">If, at 18 years old, I was supposed to figure out that governance may contradict the political campaigns that precede it.</seg>
<seg id="31">Obviously, elective office isn't a predictable course, as the opposing political party and random events, such as the Newtown massacre, will shape our public conversation.</seg>
<seg id="32">Yet, of all of the examples that I have listed above, they largely seem to be of the administration's own choosing.</seg>
<seg id="33">That is what troubles me most of all.</seg>
<seg id="34">I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited by his candidacy.</seg>
<seg id="35">Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unrefined alternative who could not seem to lock down his policies or his positions.</seg>
<seg id="36">I felt that a second term for Obama, free from the pressures of future elections, would fulfill the hope that we had heard of for so long.</seg>
<seg id="37">Still, as Obama's approval rating sank below 45% this week, returning to 2008 through that book has become that much harder.</seg>
<seg id="38">It makes me yearn for the many promises that disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="39">This week I was reading the portion of the book describing how Obama suffered a huge loss to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary.</seg>
<seg id="40">At a post-mortem campaign meeting, he told his staff that they needed to get back on track and stay true to the purpose of their cause.</seg>
<seg id="41">"I want us to get our mojo back," he said.</seg>
<seg id="42">We've got to remember who we are.'</seg>
<seg id="43">It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree with you more.</seg>
<seg id="44">The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.</seg>

<seg id="1">Father of Norway killer Anders Behring Breivik slams controversial new book</seg>
<seg id="2">Anders Behring Breivik, who killed 77 people in twin attacks in Norway last year, makes a farright salute as he enters the Oslo district courtroom at the opening of his trial on April 16, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">JENS Breivik, father of Norwegian mass-murderer Anders Behring Breivik, has spoken out against a book about his late ex-wife in which he is negatively portrayed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mother: the Story of Wenche Behring Breivik, by Marit Christensen, was released ahead of schedule on Thursday, side-stepping a threatened legal injunction to stop its publication.</seg>
<seg id="5">Jens Breivik is described in the book as a "domestic tyrant," according to Norwegian daily Dagbladet.</seg>
<seg id="6">Speaking to Norwegian radio station P4, Mr Breivik said the description of him in the book was fictional, and stressed that the author did not contact him while she was writing and researching the book.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It's completely made up," he said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Almost nothing is rooted in reality.</seg>
<seg id="9">Norwegian bookshops have reported strong demand for the book with long queues forming outside many outlets.</seg>
<seg id="10">Anders Behring Breivik was sentenced to 21 years in jail for the murders of 77 people, many of them children, in Oslo and on the island of Utoeya on July 22, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="11">Both Jens Breivik and his former wife are controversial figures in Norway.</seg>
<seg id="12">When told that his son had massacred people in cold blood, Breivik, a former diplomat who lives in France, told reporters that Anders had ruined his plans for a peaceful retirement.</seg>
<seg id="13">The marriage ended when the couple's son was only one year old, and Norwegian social services recommended that the boy be taken into care at the age of four due to his mother's mental health problems.</seg>
<seg id="14">Wenche Behring Breivik was due to speak at her son's trial, but pulled out at the last minute.</seg>
<seg id="15">She initially consented to publication of the book, granting the author several interviews, but she withdrew her consent shortly before she died in March, claiming that she had been tricked and coerced.</seg>
<seg id="16">Lawyers acting for her estate were expected to announce on Friday whether they plan to sue the publisher Aschehoug for releasing the book against their client's wishes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Gerard de Villiers, "SAS" Series Author, Dies.</seg>
<seg id="2">He never got to know the meaning of the word "retirement".</seg>
<seg id="3">Gerard de Villiers, a phenomenon of the French writing world, who died on Thursday at 83, had just published his 200th "SAS" book, "La Vengeance du Kremlin".</seg>
<seg id="4">In February, the New York Times dubbed him "the spy novelist who knew too much".</seg>
<seg id="5">He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, the setting of numbers 198 and 199 of his celebrated spy novel series.</seg>
<seg id="6">He had been in poor health since having a major heart attack in December 2010, and, on this trip, he had been using a walking frame.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prior to Afghanistan, he had also been to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gerard Villiers, who was born on 8 December 1929 in Paris, published four SAS books every year, and said he did not know how many books he had sold since the publication of "SAS à Istanbul", the first in the series, almost half a century ago in 1965.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Probably between 120 and 150 million, if you include every country," he conjectured last March.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the living room of his huge apartment in a building on Avenue Foch, just a short distance from the Arc de Triomphe, with his Burmese cat on his knee and a mischievous twinkle in his eye under the white hair, he listed some of the languages the adventures of SAS had been translated into: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese and Korean.</seg>
<seg id="11">"That's not counting the pirate publications," he added, pointing to a pile of books on the low table, between the bronze and ivory artefacts collected from the 130 countries he had surveyed for the settings of his novels.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the price of a packet of cigarettes, the reader gets a book bearing the traditional cover, featuring a photo of a young woman with an ample bosom, carrying a pistol or an assault rifle.</seg>
<seg id="13">Inside, His Serene Highness (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, a penniless Austrian aristocrat and contract agent for the CIA (to pay the bills for repairing the family mansion), is hot on the heels of all the world's evil-doers - communists in the 70s and 80s, then jihadists since the 90s.</seg>
<seg id="14">Each book follows the same formula: a large dose of geopolitics and the exotic, several racy sex scenes, a touch of violence and torture.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I never made any claim to being an author of great literature," explained Gerard de Villiers.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think of myself as a storyteller who writes to entertain people, not send them a message."</seg>
<seg id="17">He worked "like the great pre-war reporters, in the likes of Albert Londres, who went on location and came back with proper, lengthy investigations."</seg>
<seg id="18">The creator of SAS said he was "making a sort of geopolitical soap opera".</seg>
<seg id="19">"I follow up my files (on Afghanistan, Syria etc) constantly before setting off," added de Villiers.</seg>
<seg id="20">On location, I meet journalists, including those of the AFP, diplomats, and services staff, some of whom I have known for twenty or thirty years.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a result, some of his SAS novels have been premonitory: a month before an attack on a command centre of the Syrian government, in which several senior officials were killed, he had already told the story in "Le Chemin de Damas".</seg>
<seg id="22">In "Les Fous de Benghazi", he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command centre in the city, the cradle of the Libyan revolt.</seg>
<seg id="23">In 1980, he described the assassination of Egyptian president Anwar Sadat in "Le complot du Caire" a year before the attack.</seg>
<seg id="24">In October 2012, in "Panique à Bamako", he mentioned columns of 4x4s of jihadists sweeping towards the Malian capital.</seg>
<seg id="25">"I'm no seer," Gerard de Villiers would say in his defence. "I simply make conjectures based on countries that I know well and, occasionally, some of my conjectures come true."</seg>
<seg id="26">After travelling to - often troubled - zones, he would spend a month at his 1976 IBM daisy wheel typewriter, "every part of which has been replaced".</seg>
<seg id="27">300 pages later, he would write the words "The End" and correct each page by hand.</seg>
<seg id="28">On the walls of his office hang AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and photos of the author with African war lords.</seg>
<seg id="29">De Villiers was regularly criticised by feminist groups for male chauvinism and by human rights organisations for racism - accusations he would dismiss in two sentences:</seg>
<seg id="30">"Some women in my books are sex objects, others are beautiful, intelligent, brave women.</seg>
<seg id="31">I have always been well-received in Africa, where I have a very large number of readers."</seg>
<seg id="32">Gerard de Villiers said it himself: "Like all heroes, Malko Linge is ageless.</seg>
<seg id="33">He will not die and will not retire.</seg>
<seg id="34">Any more than I will."</seg>

<seg id="2">Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers injured on the evening of 31 October 2013 during a violent clash on the border between Gaza and Israel, the most serious incident in the Palestinian territory for a year.</seg>
<seg id="3">The only power plant in the Gaza Strip stopped working on Friday 1 November, following exhaustion of its fuel reserve, the Energy Authority for the Palestinian enclave announced.</seg>
<seg id="4">A local commander of the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abou Bakr, and another officer of the armed wing of Hamas, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a tank shell during an incursion by the Israeli army east of Khan Younes, in the south of the Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.</seg>
<seg id="5">Two other local officers of the Al-Qassam Brigades, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, were killed when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area.</seg>
<seg id="6">Their bodies were discovered later.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.</seg>
<seg id="8">Attack on tunnel dug by Palestinians</seg>
<seg id="9">According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and an armoured bulldozer made an incursion a hundred metres or so into the territory before retreating.</seg>
<seg id="10">The confrontation lasted half an hour, according to witnesses.</seg>
<seg id="11">In a statement, a Hamas spokesperson, Sami Abou Zouhri, paid tribute to the four "heroes" and stated that Israeli soldiers had died in the confrontation.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hamas praised the "Al-Qassam heroes who died defending the territory against an incursion at Khan Younes by the Zionist occupier.</seg>
<seg id="13">Many enemies were killed or injured during the operation.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hamas guarantees that Gaza will be hell for the occupier," the spokesperson threatened.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Israeli army, on the other hand, stated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a wide tunnel dug into Israeli territory from the Palestinian enclave, which was discovered on 7 October and, according to the army, was intended for "terrorist activities".</seg>
<seg id="16">Hamas has defended its use of tunnels in the fight against Israel, stating that the aim was to capture Israeli soldiers so they could be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="17">The operation was intended to prevent future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, explained an Israeli military statement.</seg>
<seg id="18">During the operation, Hamas triggered an explosive device targeting the "Tsahal forces" (the Israeli army) and injured five soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="19">Israeli attack in northern Syria</seg>
<seg id="20">"This mission was essential because of the risk of the terrorist tunnel being used for attacks against Israeli civilians," said army spokesperson, Peter Lerner.</seg>
<seg id="21">Furthermore, Israel attacked a military airbase in the northwest of Syria, targeting a shipment of missiles destined for the Lebanese Shiite movement Hezbollah, satellite channel Al-Arabiya reported on Thursday 31 October.</seg>
<seg id="22">A US official confirmed that there had been an "Israeli strike", but did not give details of the target.</seg>
<seg id="23">"In the past, the targets have been missiles being transferred to Hezbollah," he merely added.</seg>
<seg id="24">Israeli government officials refused to confirm any information relating to the attack.</seg>
<seg id="25">Citing "exclusive sources" that it did not name, the Saudi-owned channel stated that "the bombing targeted a shipment of ground-to-air missiles intended for Hezbollah in Lebanon," referring to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement that is fighting the rebels alongside the Syrian forces.</seg>
<seg id="26">Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, reported several explosions being heard at dawn on Wednesday in a defence airbase at Sonar Jable, near Lattaquie, on the Syrian coast.</seg>
<seg id="27">This organisation, which relies on a network of militants and medical sources, was unable to identify the origin of the explosions.</seg>

<seg id="4">By all accounts, foundation work had been going on at the site for some time.</seg>

<seg id="1">Lewis Moody: Stuart Lancaster is doing it his way and putting post-2003 errors in the past</seg>
<seg id="2">I remember being on the bench that night, sitting there and just wanting to get on.</seg>
<seg id="3">It was the biggest game of my life and I wanted to get out on that pitch.</seg>
<seg id="4">Then as time ticks on and the game is so close another feeling creeps in - what if I'm sent out there and I make the mistake that costs England the World Cup?</seg>
<seg id="5">There was a fear there.</seg>
<seg id="6">But when it came to the moment to take the field all those nerves and anxiety melted away.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was so much more enjoyable being on the pitch than sitting there watching it.</seg>
<seg id="8">That is the abiding memory.</seg>
<seg id="9">There was that line-out, taking the line-out from which Jonny Wilkinson eventually dropped that goal, but that didn't feel like any big deal - that's what we did, the call, the catch and on we go.</seg>
<seg id="10">There was no pressure or fear or anxiety by then.</seg>
<seg id="11">Because we had been through it so many times in training, preparing for all eventualities.</seg>
<seg id="12">When it came to it, it was second nature.</seg>
<seg id="13">We took the pressure off ourselves by preparing so well that we just dropped into our roles.</seg>
<seg id="14">When Jonny was lining up to take the drop goal I was waving at him to let him know the option for a cross-field kick was on.</seg>
<seg id="15">All the Aussies were focused on him.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was confident, dropped the goal and the rest is history.</seg>
<seg id="17">As a team we should have kicked on from that success but, sadly, that was not the case.</seg>
<seg id="18">What came after it was not so memorable and this is why it is so important that England and the RFU plan not just for the World Cup in 2015 but beyond too.</seg>
<seg id="19">In 2003 we had spent so long preparing for the World Cup so, when it happened and we won and Clive Woodward stepped away, there was nothing else in place.</seg>
<seg id="20">He was the driver of England's long-term vision and after his departure it was no surprise we had some torrid years.</seg>
<seg id="21">You had to feel for Andy Robinson having to take over then.</seg>
<seg id="22">The RFU is a much tighter unit now; the England team, the RFU and all of its entities are working as one team - as they always should have done.</seg>
<seg id="23">In 2003 we, the England team, knew exactly what we had to do, from the players through the coaches and the physios.</seg>
<seg id="24">Clive made sure everything was in place.</seg>
<seg id="25">But I don't think the RFU was always working as a team.</seg>
<seg id="26">It was pulling in different directions.</seg>
<seg id="27">Since Ian Ritchie took over, the RFU has taken giant leaps in working efficiently, making sure the team's success is now the priority, because that is what drives everything else within the RFU, the grass roots, the commercial, it drives everything.</seg>
<seg id="28">They have used the lessons of 2003, what went wrong and also what went right.</seg>
<seg id="29">2003 was a missed opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="30">We had that extreme euphoria.</seg>
<seg id="31">We then had a lot of retirements but that should not have upset us - it was purely that Clive left, because he was the focus.</seg>
<seg id="32">It was his management that was driving everything.</seg>
<seg id="33">When he stepped away we took steps backwards, England as a side and the RFU - it was all a bit chaotic and was not well thought through or planned.</seg>
<seg id="34">We were still a good side but we had nowhere near the success there could have been if there had been more forward-planning.</seg>
<seg id="35">We were flying by the seats of our pants.</seg>
<seg id="36">For too long England sides have been trying to emulate 2003 but Stuart Lancaster looks to be creating a team for 2015 and doing it his way.</seg>
<seg id="37">I like what I see.</seg>
<seg id="38">I went to watch training earlier this week and it made me itch to get back out there.</seg>
<seg id="39">Lancaster knows the history of the shirt, the pride and the culture that is so important, and like Clive he has got good guys in for the coaching and the medical staff.</seg>
<seg id="40">He is a forward-thinker and a precise planner.</seg>
<seg id="41">His strengths are organising and managing - that is what he is, a manager.</seg>
<seg id="42">He has a good team of coaches: Andy Farrell, a real presence who commands respect - guys want to play for him - Mike Catt, who has real understanding of how rugby should be played, and Graham Rowntree.</seg>
<seg id="43">Winning a World Cup is about having long-term goals, and shorter ones too to sustain the journey.</seg>
<seg id="44">Autumn has always been about blooding new talent but winning this first game against Australia is so important - win and it makes the rest of the autumn so much smoother.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are a number of big chances to be seized.</seg>
<seg id="46">Joel Tomkins is a good defender - league players seem to understand and read attacks so well when they come over - and he is also an interesting prospect in attack.</seg>
<seg id="47">It is a massive opportunity for Courtney Lawes to show Lancaster what he's about, a big, imposing, physical second row.</seg>
<seg id="48">We need someone akin to Martin Johnson, Danny Grewcock, Wade Dooley, that enforcer, and you need to ally that with someone who has the intelligence to call the line-outs.</seg>
<seg id="49">There is a lot of pressure on Lawes, as a player and as the man who calls the line-outs.</seg>
<seg id="50">It will be interesting to see how he handles the decision-making process.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lee Dickson is the surprise inclusion.</seg>
<seg id="52">Ben Youngs had a good summer with the Lions and I would have started with him.</seg>
<seg id="53">He gives you that exciting edge, speed around the base, and he asks a lot of defences.</seg>
<seg id="54">But Dickson has been playing well.</seg>
<seg id="55">Competition for places is what drives teams to perform.</seg>
<seg id="56">In 2003 the competition was huge.</seg>
<seg id="57">Look at scrum-half: you had Kyran Bracken, Matt Dawson and Andy Gomarsall, and Austin Healey didn't even go.</seg>
<seg id="58">You had four guys who on their day were all world-class players.</seg>
<seg id="59">That sort of competition drives individuals week in, week out.</seg>
<seg id="60">England are getting there.</seg>
<seg id="61">There are a couple of positions where I think Lancaster would want a bit more, the wings and No 8 for example - which is why it's exciting to see Billy Vunipola get his chance.</seg>
<seg id="62">He offers a physical presence off the base that Lawrence Dallaglio used to bring.</seg>
<seg id="63">There is one final point about this line-up.</seg>
<seg id="64">Look at the bench: Ben Foden back in form, Youngs off the back of a Lions tour, Toby Flood with 57 caps and two World Cups, Dylan Hartley closing on 50 caps.</seg>
<seg id="65">Keep in the mind the likes of Tom Croft and Manu Tuilagi missing through injuries and it's a strong group Lancaster is bringing together.</seg>
<seg id="66">He said they need 600 caps in the side if they are going to win the World Cup and that has been proved historically.</seg>
<seg id="67">There is a long way to go but it is really exciting times.</seg>

<seg id="2">Since the Federal government recognised same-sex marriage, "all spouses of military officers have a right to an identity card from the Department of Defense and to the associated benefits," said the Secretary of Defense in New York, in a speech to the Anti-Defamation League for the fight against anti-Semitism.</seg>
<seg id="3">"However, some states have refused to issue these cards to same sex spouses in facilities of the National Guard" set up in their region, he criticised, accusing these states of violating federal law and the principle of equality.</seg>
<seg id="4">Without these cards, such individuals cannot take advantage of numerous social or healthcare services in these bases, or access the shops of the latter.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Secretary of Defense said he had ordered the Chief of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure that federal law was implemented.</seg>
<seg id="6">The refusal by the nine states started with Texas, which refused to implement these measures in Texan National Guard facilities due to a conflict between Texan law and the federal law on same-sex marriage.</seg>
<seg id="7">Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, followed in refusal, according to a senior Defense official.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Pentagon estimates that the population concerned by the recognition of same-sex marriage involves about 5,600 active individuals, or 17,000 if the National Guard, the reserve and retired people are included.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British entrepreneur has created the world's first glow-in-the-dark ice cream - using jellyfish.</seg>
<seg id="3">Charlie Francis has harnessed the fluorescent properties of the marine animal to develop the luminescent snack.</seg>
<seg id="4">He came up with the idea after reading a research paper on jellyfish and convinced scientists in China to chemically recreate the glowing protein.</seg>
<seg id="5">The ice cream reacts with the eater's tongue - raising the pH level in the protein and making it glow.</seg>
<seg id="6">Chris says because the ice cream lights up when it reacts with the heat of the mouth it means the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Charlie, founder of the "Lick Me I'm Delicious" ice cream company, said: "It is incredible stuff but still at very early days in terms of production, so £200 gets you about 2g of the stuff."</seg>
<seg id="8">The protein we are using in the ice cream reacts with your tongue at neutral pH.</seg>
<seg id="9">So as your mouth warms up the protein it will raise the pH level and the ice cream will glow.</seg>
<seg id="10">We have been testing it out over the past few months and it seemed perfect to share it over Halloween because it gives that wonderful glow effect.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have made because the jellyfish luminescence is four times more expensive than gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">So each scoop costs me around £140.</seg>
<seg id="13">It tastes pretty good though.</seg>
<seg id="14">Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is famed for its unusual flavours including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.</seg>
<seg id="15">But his next creation is set to be even more ambitious.</seg>
<seg id="16">He said: "I really want to develop an invisible ice cream."</seg>
<seg id="17">It is inherently impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals which make up the ice cream, but I reckon we will find a way of doing it.</seg>
<seg id="18">The ice cream harnesses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish, synthesized by Chinese scientists</seg>

<seg id="2">BEIJING (Reuters) - China's giant manufacturing sector grew at its fastest rate in seven months in October, buoyed by new export orders, a private survey showed on Friday, adding to signs that the economy is stabilizing in the run up to a key government meeting on economic reform.</seg>
<seg id="3">A reading above 50 indicates expansion, while a figure below this indicates a contraction.</seg>
<seg id="4">China's official PMI released earlier in the day put manufacturing growth at 51.4, the highest in 18 months.</seg>
<seg id="5">The official PMI is weighted more towards bigger and state owned enterprises and tends to produce more favorable results than the private survey, which focuses more on smaller and private sector firms</seg>
<seg id="6">The HSBC survey showed a surprise jump in new export orders to 51.3, up from the initial reading of 50.8.</seg>
<seg id="7">Many of the surveyed firms reported stronger demand from the United States in particular.</seg>
<seg id="8">Domestic new orders also grew at their fastest pace since March, though they were down slightly on the number reported in the flash estimate.</seg>
<seg id="9">Signs that the economy is doing well will help the government push its agenda for restructuring it towards one driven more by consumer demand than investment and credit at the upcoming Communist Party's third plenary meeting from November 9 to November 12.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the first nine months of the year, the $8.5 trillion economy grew 7.7 percent from a year earlier, putting it on track to achieve Beijing's 2013 target of 7.5 percent, although that would be the weakest growth rate in 23 years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Alleged Whitehaven hoaxer denies charge</seg>
<seg id="2">An environmentalist accused of a hoax that damaged Whitehaven's share price has pleaded not guilty.</seg>
<seg id="3">A NSW environmentalist charged with issuing a hoax press release that allegedly wiped hundreds of millions of dollars off the value of a mining company has pleaded not guilty.</seg>
<seg id="4">Jonathan Moylan, 25, appeared in the Supreme Court in Sydney on Friday where he pleaded not guilty to a charge of disseminating false material likely to induce people in Australia to dispose of Whitehaven shares.</seg>
<seg id="5">Last January, the Newcastle-based activist allegedly sent a press release to media outlets claiming ANZ Bank had withdrawn a $1.2 billion loan from Whitehaven's Maules Creek open cut coal mine on ethical grounds.</seg>
<seg id="6">The media release bore the ANZ Bank logo, and the hoax allegedly temporarily wiped $314 million from the miner's share price.</seg>
<seg id="7">Moylan was initially expected to face the District Court, but prosecutors successfully applied to have him tried in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="8">He will stand trial on June 30.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is expected to last three weeks.</seg>
<seg id="10">Moylan is supported by environmentalist groups who have accused Whitehaven of planning to destroy 1360 hectares of koala habitat and forcing farmers off their land through soil damage from its flagship Maules Creek project in north-western NSW.</seg>
<seg id="11">Local farmer Rick Laird, who says his property was threatened by Whitehaven's proposed mine, travelled to Sydney to support Moylan.</seg>
<seg id="12">He said his family had owned property in the area for 150 years and was the namesake of the Leard State Forest, two thirds of which would be destroyed if the proposed mines went ahead.</seg>
<seg id="13">"We've been fighting these mines for years, and people are finally starting to hear about it," he said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="14">If these mines go ahead, it's the end of our livelihoods.</seg>
<seg id="15">We won't be able to farm the land and we worry about the impact of coal dust on our health.</seg>

<seg id="1">Coulson used phone hacking to verify tip</seg>
<seg id="2">Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm a bogus tip about an affair involving then-home secretary Charles Clarke.</seg>
<seg id="3">Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey that the News of the World heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke was seeing his "attractive special adviser," Hannah Pawlby.</seg>
<seg id="4">The newspaper tasked private investigator Glenn Mulcaire with hacking Pawlby's voicemails and "door-stepped" her, but Coulson also called and left her voicemails, the court heard.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The prosecution suggests that Mr Coulson, who is now the editor of the NotW, he is not the man who stands outside people's houses hoping to catch them out, he is the man who likes to put the story to people to see what they will say," Mr Edis said.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said the NotW used three ways to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.</seg>
<seg id="7">The editor is personally involved in the third.</seg>
<seg id="8">Obviously he knows about the second, surveillance, he must do.</seg>
<seg id="9">What about the first?</seg>
<seg id="10">Does he know about phone hacking?</seg>
<seg id="11">He says he doesn't, we say "Oh yes, he did".</seg>
<seg id="12">Rumours about an affair involving Clarke were first picked up by the NotW's features desk when a source who was sexually interested in Ms Pawlby was told: "Don't bother wasting your time, she's with Charles."</seg>
<seg id="13">A tape of voicemails taken from her phone on at least three occasions was seized from Mulcaire's home in August 2006.</seg>
<seg id="14">Investigators also found entries on the private investigator's computer which had Ms Pawlby and her sister as "Projects."</seg>
<seg id="15">During the period she was being investigated, Ms Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr Edis said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw surveillance of Ms Pawlby's movements.</seg>
<seg id="17">Leaving her a voicemail on June 18 2005, Coulson told her: "I've got a story that we're planning to run tomorrow that I really would like to speak to Charles about."</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr Edis said Coulson's involvement in the story followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former home secretary David Blunkett.</seg>
<seg id="19">The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson confronted Mr Blunkett over an affair with a married woman while he was himself seeing co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was married at the time.</seg>
<seg id="20">Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3 2000 and August 9 2006.</seg>
<seg id="21">Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted phone hacking.</seg>

<seg id="2">General Motors Co is recalling nearly 19,000 of its all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks to repair a problem with the manual reclining seatback, according to a notice from U.S. auto safety regulators on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">On some of the trucks, the front seats may have a defect in the reclining mechanism.</seg>
<seg id="4">As a result, the seatbacks fail to comply with federal auto safety standards on head restraints.</seg>
<seg id="5">"If the vehicle is struck from behind, the head restraint may not properly protect occupants, increasing the risk of injury," according to the notice posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website.</seg>
<seg id="6">The recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10.</seg>
<seg id="7">GM's truck roll-out began in June and represents the most important vehicle launch for the No. 1 U.S. automaker since its 2009 bankruptcy restructuring.</seg>

<seg id="1">Santa Monica officials sue FAA to gain control of city's airport</seg>
<seg id="2">In the wake of September's deadly jet crash, Santa Monica officials sued the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday to gain control of the city's embattled airport, which local groups want to turn into a park.</seg>
<seg id="3">Filed in U.S. District Court in downtown Los Angeles, the lawsuit seeks a declaration that the city holds clear title to the 227 acres containing the oldest continuously operating airport in the county.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also challenges the constitutionality of a 1948 agreement between the city and federal authorities that requires the historic property and its 5,000-foot runway to remain an airport in perpetuity or be returned at the option of the FAA to the U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="5">If the city is successful, there is concern among aviation organizations that it might alter the status of former military airports around the nation and encourage attempts to close some of them.</seg>
<seg id="6">During World War II, the Defense Department took over Santa Monica Municipal Airport and improved its runway, taxiways and other facilities for military purposes and aircraft production.</seg>
<seg id="7">It returned the airfield to the city under terms to preserve its use.</seg>
<seg id="8">Santa Monica officials and airport opponents contend the obligation to operate the airport ends in 2015, according to various agreements and a 1984 court settlement with the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="9">We need to get these legal questions answered.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The community expects us to protect their health, safety and welfare," said Santa Monica Mayor Pam O'Connor, making note of the private jet that veered off the runway Sept.</seg>
<seg id="11">29 and smashed into a hangar, killing four people.</seg>
<seg id="12">O'Connor added that city officials want to determine whether they fully control the airport so they can make decisions next year about its future, including the possibility of turning it into a park.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I'm encouraged that Mayor O'Connor included protecting community health," said Martin Rubin, an anti-airport activist who lives near the popular facility.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is a huge part of the equation, and the federal government needs to be accountable with regard to the health of airport neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="15">FAA officials declined to comment, saying that as a matter of policy they do not discuss pending litigation.</seg>
<seg id="16">The agency's long-held position is that the city must operate the airport through 2023 under assurances it gave in exchange for federal airport improvement grants.</seg>
<seg id="17">The FAA also has asserted that Santa Monica is further obligated to keep the airport open well beyond 2023 because it acquired the much improved airfield after World War II under terms of the federal Surplus Property Act.</seg>
<seg id="18">FAA officials have said in the past that they are committed to preserving the federal investment and keeping the airport open.</seg>
<seg id="19">The lawsuit, like the city's constant attempts to close the airport or restrict its operations, is expected to attract the attention of the local aviation community and national organizations such as the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Assn. and the National Business Aviation Assn.</seg>
<seg id="20">"It is abundantly clear that the claims made in the city's lawsuit have no basis in fact," said Ken Mead, general counsel for the pilots association.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city's argument is hardly a novel one, and it should be very clear by now to members of the Santa Monica City Council and opponents of the airport that the airport must remain in operation under its agreement with the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="22">If the court overturns Santa Monica's 1948 transfer documents, it might open the door to efforts to close or re-purpose other airports around the country that were returned to local governments after World War II.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the pilots association, there are at least 203 such airfields.</seg>
<seg id="24">Over the years, attempts by Santa Monica to shut down the airport and curtail jet operations have not been successful in court.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the latest effort to ban jets with fast landing speeds, a federal appeals court ruled against the city in 2011, concluding that the prohibition illegally discriminated against aircraft types.</seg>

<seg id="1">UN hails new goals to tackle poverty</seg>
<seg id="2">The United Nations is to start work immediately on a new set of goals to replace the millennium development goals, which were put place 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.</seg>
<seg id="3">Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for "sustainable development goals" to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015, ahead of the UN sustainable development summit that began in Rio de Janeiro overnight.</seg>
<seg id="4">They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be endorsed by world leaders including Ms Gillard during the summit.</seg>
<seg id="5">UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the summit overnight that now is the time to "rise above national interests."</seg>
<seg id="6">"I am pleased that member states have agreed to launch and take ownership of a process to establish universal sustainable development goals - SDGs," he said.</seg>
<seg id="7">These SDGs will build on our advances under the millennium development goals, and they will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.</seg>
<seg id="8">I will spare no effort to implement the mandate given to me by member states to realise our vision of sustainable development goals that build on the success of the MDGs.</seg>

<seg id="1">Parramatta great Brett Kenny says Brisbane Broncos will rue losing Corey Norman to Eels</seg>
<seg id="2">Brisbane Broncos five-eighth Corey Norman has signed a big-money deal with the Eels.</seg>
<seg id="3">PARRAMATTA'S greatest five-eighth Brett Kenny says the Broncos will rue losing Corey Norman, saying the Eels' big-money recruit has the talent to play for Queensland.</seg>
<seg id="4">Norman will get a glimpse of his future when he runs on to Parramatta Stadium tomorrow night to face the Eels, the club he will join next season.</seg>
<seg id="5">Norman is slated to wear the blue-and-gold No.</seg>
<seg id="6">6 jumper made famous by Kenny, who with scrumbase partner Peter Sterling piloted Parramatta to four premierships in the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="7">Former NSW Origin pivot Kenny will attend tomorrow night's clash, and believes an alliance between Norman and Chris Sandow can be the Eels' most successful halves combination since his lethal union with Sterling.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I find it very surprising the Broncos let him go," said Kenny, who played 265 top-grade games from 1980-93.</seg>
<seg id="9">When Wayne Bennett was there, you look at the culture he built at the Broncos, and I was always cautious of a player that was let go by Brisbane.</seg>
<seg id="10">You think there has to be something wrong with them.</seg>
<seg id="11">They don't let too many guys go if they have some ability, so it was a shock (for Norman to leave).</seg>
<seg id="12">I'm not saying Corey has issues, but it's not like the Broncos to lose kids of his ability.</seg>
<seg id="13">It could be our best halves pairing in a long time.</seg>
<seg id="14">Chris Sandow is obviously finding it a bit hard at times.</seg>
<seg id="15">Parramatta supporters have been critical of him, but at (former club) Souths he was playing behind a bigger pack.</seg>
<seg id="16">Norman will be a good foil for him.</seg>
<seg id="17">Norman will wage a backfield duel with Parramatta fullback Jarryd Hayne tomorrow night, but the 21-year-old's desire to settle at five-eighth sealed his $1.3 million defection to the Eels.</seg>
<seg id="18">Coach Ricky Stuart is confident he can develop Norman into a representative player and Kenny, a veteran of 17 Tests and 17 Origin matches, also believes Norman can take the next step.</seg>
<seg id="19">"He's probably not (ready) but if he keeps improving . . . he has the ability to play Origin," Kenny said.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Broncos travel to Sydney today, with prop Josh McGuire, named on a six-man bench, hopeful of overcoming a calf injury to press his Origin claims.</seg>
<seg id="21">"They have a massive forward pack with guys like Fuifui (Moimoi) and Tim Mannah so it's a good test for us and me personally," McGuire said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ukraine Close to Economic Collapse</seg>
<seg id="2">Rating agency, Standard & Poor's, reduced Ukraine's credit rating on Friday, casting a doubt on the ability of the former Soviet republic, which has been in recession for a year, to meet its financial obligations.</seg>
<seg id="3">The government debt rating moved to B-, further down into the category of speculative investments.</seg>
<seg id="4">This rating is accompanied by a negative outlook, with S&P seeing at least one chance in three that it will downgrade the rating again in the next year.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It is increasingly unlikely that the government's strategy will make it possible to sufficiently guarantee foreign currencies to meet its increased external financial commitments," explained the American agency.</seg>
<seg id="6">The agency notes that Ukraine's foreign exchange reserves fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013, and the trend is expected to continue.</seg>
<seg id="7">This complicates the repayment of credit from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="8">These reserves, which the authorities have had to use extensively to support the local currency, the hryvnia, are collapsing, leading to the agency considering devaluation more and more likely, which would inflate the country's foreign debt.</seg>
<seg id="9">Moreover, Kiev needs liquid assets to pay for its gas imports from Russia, which accuses it of not having paid a bill of 882 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="10">The announcement comes as bad news for the Ukrainian government in a period of serious tension with its Russian neighbour, which is furious with Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.</seg>
<seg id="11">This was made public the day after the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had suffered its fifth consecutive quarterly drop between July and September.</seg>
<seg id="12">Its debt, which is still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years. S&P estimates it as 33.5% of the GDP, as opposed to 10% prior to the crisis of 2008-2009.</seg>
<seg id="13">Experiencing a budgetary deficit, the country has been asking for aid from the International Monetary Fund for months. The latter, in 2010, had given the former a 15,300 million dollars loan, but this time it has released just 3,400 million.</seg>
<seg id="14">The IMF is refusing to pay any further installments until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, especially by increasing the price of gas for the population.</seg>
<seg id="15">Following a fruitless mission to the country, the IMF noted this week that "the significant need for external finance" represented "a weakness", even though there were "signs of economic improvement".</seg>
<seg id="16">However, for the economist, Oleksandr Joloud, from the Centre for Political Studies, "no improvement can be expected in the short term".</seg>
<seg id="17">"There is little hope of unpopular reforms being made in a pre-election year," said the expert in an AFP interview. Presidential elections are planned for 2015.</seg>
<seg id="18">The only hope is for an improvement in international circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="19">S&P notes, furthermore, the "uncertainty" linked to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which for Brussels is conditional on the release of opposition leader Yulia Timochenko.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Signing the agreement would be good for business in the long term, but it might have negative consequences in the short term in relation to Russia's reaction," explained S&P, which is concerned Moscow may introduce "trade restrictions".</seg>
<seg id="21">Russia, which is responsible for a quarter of Ukrainian exports, has warned that if a free trade area is created between the EU and Kiev, it will have to reinforce its border controls for imported goods.</seg>

<seg id="2">On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a set of guidelines to manage children's food allergies at school.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is the first set of such guidelines the U.S. government has put out, as the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies climbs.</seg>
<seg id="4">One in 20 children in the United States now have food allergies.</seg>
<seg id="5">The CDC found the prevalence of food allergies among children increased 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.</seg>
<seg id="6">The guide contains information for schools on how to make faculty and staff aware of children's food allergies, and how to handle them should an allergic reaction occur.</seg>
<seg id="7">It also recommends schools have epinephrine stocked -- the EpiPen brand auto-injector being most commonly used -- to respond to potentially fatal anaphylaxis.</seg>
<seg id="8">State legislatures have recently been updating rules to allow schools to stock epinephrine more easily.</seg>
<seg id="9">The report also includes a list of typical symptoms communicated by children who are having an allergic reaction.</seg>
<seg id="10">Kids may say, "It feels like something is poking my tongue," "My tongue feels like there is hair on it," or "My tongue is tingling."</seg>

<seg id="4">TWO days after Sebastian Vettel's fourth title triumph, the Formula One spotlight shifted to London's High Court with the latest case that places Bernie Ecclestone's future in doubt.</seg>
<seg id="5">At a London trial, which began today, former F1 shareholder, German media company Constantin Medien, is suing Ecclestone and three other defendants for up to $US144 million, claiming F1 was undervalued at the time of the sale.</seg>
<seg id="6">The longtime commercial head of F1 is already under investigation in Germany over an alleged payment of $US44 million relating to the sale of the motorsport series in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="7">A German court won't say until next year whether Ecclestone will stand trial on charges of bribery and incitement to breach of trust.</seg>
<seg id="8">German banker Gerhard Gribkowsky has already been jailed for taking the payment from Ecclestone.</seg>
<seg id="9">Gribkowsky was in charge of selling the bank BayernLB's stake in F1 to investment group CVC Capital Partners.</seg>
<seg id="10">Ecclestone - estimated by Forbes magazine to be worth $US3.8 billion - was not at the High Court but is expected to give evidence next week.</seg>
<seg id="11">Barrister Philip Marshall, representing Constantin Medien, accused Ecclestone of making a "corrupt bargain" with Gribkowsky "to facilitate a sale of the Formula One Group by a purchaser chosen by Mr. Ecclestone in return for remuneration (for Gribkowsky) and a position (for Ecclestone) relating to Formula One going forward."</seg>
<seg id="12">To that end, Constantin Medien is claiming it lost out due to the deal negotiated by Gribkowsky.</seg>
<seg id="13">Gribkowsky is a defendant in the case along with Ecclestone's lawyer, Stephen Mullens, and the Ecclestone family trust, Bambino Holdings.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ecclestone and Bambino benefited by more than $1 billion from the sale of the 47 per cent stake, according to Marshall, figures that gave F1 an enterprise value of more than $US3 billion in "stark contrast" to the actual value of "just in excess" of $US2 billion at the time of the sale.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We see this transaction as being significantly weighted for the benefit of Mr. Ecclestone and Bambino, and significantly to the detriment of BayernLB," Marshall said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ecclestone is accused of paying Gribkowsky $US44 million across 2006 and 2007.</seg>
<seg id="17">"A variety of means were used to conceal the fact the payments were made," Marshall said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Ecclestone built his powerbase in F1 from the 1970s and helped to create the Formula One Constructors' Association that controlled the business side of the series, including selling the TV rights.</seg>
<seg id="19">The British-based company later became known as Formula One Management.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has fought regular tussles with the teams over finances, but has retained control of the global motor racing extravaganza.</seg>
<seg id="21">CVC, having amassed a 63 per cent stake of F1, has reduced its holding as other investors have come on board in recent years, although a planned flotation has stalled.</seg>
<seg id="22">Ecclestone's holding has been diluted to about 5 per cent.</seg>

<seg id="1">Study explains how a job-market system lands couples in the same city</seg>
<seg id="2">1, 2013 - Since World War II, women have entered the American workforce in greater numbers than ever before.</seg>
<seg id="3">For married couples, this presents a wrinkle, since it can be hard for both partners to find a desirable job in the same locale.</seg>
<seg id="4">This issue is particularly pressing in some specialized fields.</seg>
<seg id="5">When doctors graduate from medical school, for instance, they apply for their first jobs through a national clearinghouse in which both job-seekers and institutions express their preferences; a computer program determines the results.</seg>
<seg id="6">That means two-doctor couples are often fearful of not landing in the same geographic location.</seg>
<seg id="7">Now a paper co-authored by an MIT economist sheds new light on the circumstances in which these job-placement programs can, in fact, accommodate married couples quite well.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Our results provide justification for the current rules in practice," says MIT economist Parag Pathak, who helped conduct the study to "try to understand how far we are from some kind of optimal system."</seg>
<seg id="9">In many cases, the answer appears to be: not far at all.</seg>
<seg id="10">If the method used is properly calibrated to the size of the job market, the researchers found, then the clearinghouse should work for nearly everyone, couples included.</seg>
<seg id="11">Seeing if an ad-hoc system works</seg>
<seg id="12">The paper, "Matching with Couples: Stability and Incentives in Large Markets," published this month by the Quarterly Journal of Economics, was written by economists Fuhito Kojima and Alvin Roth of Stanford University, along with Pathak.</seg>
<seg id="13">All three scholars work in the field of "market design," where they seek to devise rules bringing desirable outcomes to social systems.</seg>
<seg id="14">The paper blends theory and empiricism, bridging the gap between theoretical work suggesting these medical markets cannot work very well and recent data indicating that many clearinghouses do function quite efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="15">In medicine, these mechanisms aim to create a set of "stable matching" results for each year's applicant pool -- that is, job placements in which, after preferences are listed, interviews are conducted, and mutual job decisions are made, there are no remaining pairs of doctors and hospitals who would sooner be matched with each other, but are not.</seg>
<seg id="16">These job-market clearinghouses are built on a simple theory first formalized in 1962 by mathematicians David Gale and Lloyd Shapely.</seg>
<seg id="17">They designed an influential "deferred acceptance" algorithm showing how prospective market partners could pair off without any preferred matches being ignored.</seg>
<seg id="18">But in the medical job market, that theory breaks down when couples apply for jobs at the same time; the 1962 algorithm depends on everyone making decisions independently.</seg>
<seg id="19">In medicine, the centralized job-placement system originated in the 1950s, and by the 1970s, it was increasingly common to find married couples entering the medical job market together.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a result, these clearinghouses began to change their mechanisms by the 1990s, allowing married couples to rank preferences for pairs of jobs.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, "There had never been any real formal basis for those tweaks," says Pathak, an associate professor in MIT's Department of Economics.</seg>
<seg id="22">That meant it was not clear if there were a better system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Moreover, some previous theoretical work in the field suggested that placing married couples in the same applicant pool as single doctors could make it impossible to find a stable matching.</seg>
<seg id="24">Mathematicians have shown that in some cases, even computing whether a stable matching exists is practically impossible.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The theoretical results seemed to contradict the actual performance of the real-world markets," Pathak says.</seg>
<seg id="26">Together, Kojima, Pathak, and Roth worked out the assumptions under which it is possible to reconcile the theory with the practice, and used data from the job market for clinical psychologists to test their theory.</seg>
<seg id="27">Good test results for doctors</seg>
<seg id="28">The researchers found that in order to find a stable outcome, the job market has to be fairly large; that married couples cannot constitute a large portion of the applicant pool; and that applicants must not rank every residency program.</seg>
<seg id="29">And while it might seem intuitive that larger job markets will provide better opportunities, the researchers were able to arrive at some specific conclusions: If there are at least 2,000 jobs available in a given area, and if the number of couples equals the square root of the market size, then a stable matching will occur at least 96 percent of the time.</seg>
<seg id="30">That corresponds with data from the job clearinghouse used by the Association of Psychology Postdoctoral and Internship Centers (APPIC) from 1999 to 2007, the researchers found that, on average, there were 3,010 single applicants and 19 pairs of married applicants annually.</seg>
<seg id="31">Moreover, the APPIC data from those years did not record any instances of two-doctor couples who were unable to land in jobs in a stable outcome.</seg>
<seg id="32">The APPIC numbers also show that only 2 percent of the single applicants have had their preferences affected by the presence of married couples in the market.</seg>
<seg id="33">In all, the positive prognosis for doctors is that current circumstances are helping their job-market clearinghouses work well.</seg>
<seg id="34">But for his part, Pathak also regards the paper as just one result in the larger scholarly effort to improve the methods employed in actual markets.</seg>
<seg id="35">The motivation of all such studies, he notes, is "coming up with practical solutions to real problems."</seg>

<seg id="3">Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told jurors at the Old Bailey that a story in the News of the World came from a voicemail that was illegally accessed by private investigator Glenn Mulcaire on behalf of the tabloid's former royal editor Clive Goodman.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is claimed that the then editor Andy Coulson was also aware of what was happening.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr Edis said the story, published on December 18, 2005, was one of a number of stories cited by Goodman as he tried to justify paying Mulcaire a weekly retainer.</seg>
<seg id="6">The prosecutor said the story, which ran under the headline "Harry's aide helps out on Sandhurst exams," had "got into the paper and was based entirely on a voicemail."</seg>
<seg id="7">Payments</seg>
<seg id="8">The court heard that Coulson stopped weekly payments to Mulcaire in February 2006, and on the same day Goodman emailed him justifying them in a bid to keep them going.</seg>
<seg id="9">Referring to Mulcaire only as "matey," the royal editor said he was a valuable source of stories on the royal family, especially after William started at Sandhurst.</seg>
<seg id="10">He wrote: "We are the only paper getting any information out of there at all about his movements and Kate's."</seg>
<seg id="11">The court heard that one version of the message, handed to Harbottle and Lewis, ended there, but another version, downloaded by Goodman after he was charged in 2006 and also obtained from the News International system, went on: "There have been several close calls that could have made us some great pics."</seg>
<seg id="12">We were five minutes away from catching Kate and William together last Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr Edis said that although seeing the now-married couple together would not be unusual nowadays, at the time there was interest in it.</seg>
<seg id="14">The court heard Goodman told Coulson: "This sort of information is not manageable on a story by story basis," as he described that there were costs of setting up and maintaining surveillance and said Mulcaire was not a "hack" and did not understand what was or was not a story.</seg>
<seg id="15">Justifying the payments, Goodman wrote: "It's safe, productive and cost effective and I am confident it will become a big story goldmine for us if we let it run a bit longer."</seg>
<seg id="16">Aide to Prince of Wales</seg>
<seg id="17">Jurors were also told that a top aide to the Prince of Wales was targeted by NotW journalists, chasing false rumours that the Royal's private secretary Sir Michael Peat had been having an affair.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prosecutors claim that Goodman paid for two copies of a Royal telephone directory from palace police officers, with the funds allegedly authorised by Coulson.</seg>
<seg id="19">A total of 15 copies of the book were found in his home when it was searched in 2006, and of those it is claimed that another two belonged to police but were not necessarily sold by officers, the court heard.</seg>
<seg id="20">One had an officer's fingerprint on it while another had an officer's handwriting on it.</seg>
<seg id="21">The court heard that on January 24 2003 Goodman emailed Coulson to say: "Andy - one of our royal policemen (St James Palace) has obtained the brand new green book, the telephone directory with all the home numbers of the royal family and their household staff."</seg>
<seg id="22">Incredibly useful and he'll be extremely handy in the Peat Affair tale.</seg>
<seg id="23">The standard price is GBP1,000.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the version of the message found on Goodman's computer, but apparently not received by Coulson, another paragraph said: "I think that we should have the book and the goodwill that goes with it but I am keen to avoid Round Two with the Man Ed (managing editor Stuart Kuttner)."</seg>
<seg id="25">I'm not criticising Stuart at all, but these people will not be paid in anything other than cash because if they're discovered selling stuff to us they end up on criminal charges, as could we.</seg>
<seg id="26">Coulson replied to the shorter message, questioning why he had recently signed off on a payment of £750 for another copy of the directory.</seg>
<seg id="27">Goodman answered: "This is the harder to get one which has the Queen's direct lines to her family in it."</seg>
<seg id="28">Mr Edis said that, as a result of that conversation, a cash payment of £1,000 was made to a David Farish, which turned out to be a false name, adding: "The investigation has never identified the policeman responsible for this."</seg>
<seg id="29">He said the conversation and payment was the "clearest possible evidence" of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office and that it was linked to phone hacking.</seg>
<seg id="30">Investigating</seg>
<seg id="31">The jury heard that on the same day the Green Book was bought, which included an address and landlines but no mobile number for Sir Michael, Mulcaire was tasked with investigating him.</seg>
<seg id="32">A mobile number was later handwritten on to the book.</seg>
<seg id="33">The court was shown a heavily-redacted copy of the book, featuring a host of telephone numbers and addresses.</seg>
<seg id="34">Mr Edis said there were a number of black marks on the book to protect the privacy of those in it.</seg>
<seg id="35">He said: "Glenn carried on with his investigation and if that's right this book is directly useful for phone hacking, and in fact used for phone hacking, because Sir Michael Peat is targeted on the very same day the book is paid for."</seg>
<seg id="36">As part of his prosecution opening on Thursday, Mr Edis revealed that Rebekah Brooks and Coulson had an affair for at least six years, thought to be from 1998 to 2004, as he used it to demonstrate how close they were.</seg>
<seg id="37">Letter</seg>
<seg id="38">The court heard extracts from a heartfelt letter sent by Brooks to her then deputy editor Coulson in February 2004, said to have been written after he tried to end their relationship, in which she declared her love for him.</seg>
<seg id="39">Brooks, 45, of Churchill, Oxfordshire; Coulson, also 45, from Charing in Kent; former NotW head of news Ian Edmondson, 44, from Raynes Park, south west London; and the tabloid's ex-managing editor Kuttner, 73, from Woodford Green, Essex, all deny conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3 2000 and August 9 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Former News International chief executive Brooks is also accused of two counts of conspiring with others to commit misconduct in public office - one between January 1 2004 and January 31 2012 and the other between February 9 2006 and October 16 2008 - linked to alleged inappropriate payments to public officials.</seg>
<seg id="41">Coulson is also facing two allegations that he conspired with Goodman, 56, from Addlestone in Surrey, and other unknown people to commit misconduct in public office - between August 31 2002 and January 31 2003, and between January 31 and June 3 2005.</seg>
<seg id="42">Brooks also faces two allegations of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice - one with her former personal assistant Cheryl Carter, 49, from Chelmsford in Essex, between July 6 and 9 2011; and a second with her husband, Charles Brooks, and former head of security at News International, Mark Hanna, and others between July 15 and July 19 2011.</seg>

<seg id="2">An Ohio father who walked his daughter down the aisle on a gurney at her wedding has died less than three weeks after fulfilling his promise.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scott Nagy, 56, who had been bed-ridden since August, died of complications related to his debilitating cancer at University Hospitals in Cleveland on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="4">"He was pretty compromised two weeks ago when he went to the wedding," said Hospital spokesman Vic Gideon.</seg>
<seg id="5">He just wanted to live long enough to walk his daughter down the aisle.</seg>
<seg id="6">Nagy had refused to break his promise he made back in March to walk his only daughter, Sarah, down the aisle on her wedding day.</seg>
<seg id="7">"He promised that he'd be there and he was," Sarah Nagy told ABCNews.com.</seg>
<seg id="8">Scott Nagy arrived at the First Evangelical Lutheran Church in Strongsville, Ohio, on Oct 12 in an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="9">He wore a tuxedo and smiled and held his daughter Sarah's hand as he was wheeled down the aisle on a gurney.</seg>
<seg id="10">When I walked out and saw him there, I couldn't think.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I couldn't focus," said Sarah Nagy.</seg>
<seg id="12">There was my dad sitting there in his tuxedo, looking amazing and wondering why I was crying.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the wedding Sarah said her father said to her, "This should be a happy day."</seg>
<seg id="14">Wipe those tears off your face.</seg>
<seg id="15">We're not crying down the aisle.</seg>
<seg id="16">The proud father smiled the entire way down the aisle.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nagy was diagnosed with urethral cancer in 2012 and underwent chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="18">Sarah got engaged in February and her father was responding positively to his medication and doing well.</seg>
<seg id="19">The wedding was originally planned for 2014.</seg>
<seg id="20">"He was up and about and we all figured he'll be there, no problem," his wife Jean Nagy told ABCNews.com.</seg>
<seg id="21">Then at the end of August, Nagy took a turn for the worse and it became clear that his time might be limited.</seg>
<seg id="22">When the decision was made to have the wedding in the fall, a team of people mobilized to make it happen for the family.</seg>
<seg id="23">Jacky Uljanic, nurse practitioner from the hospital, visited the church and reception hall to take care of the logistics for the family.</seg>
<seg id="24">She helped Nagy with therapy to build up his strength.</seg>
<seg id="25">A medical transport group donated the ambulance trip and doctors, EMTs and nurses insisted on working on their day off to help the family.</seg>
<seg id="26">Nagy was too tired to make it to the reception, but someone donated a projector, which an IT volunteered to set up, and he gave his toast via a remote video connection.</seg>
<seg id="27">"It was so beautiful and the thing was all these people donated their time and efforts," Jean Nagy said.</seg>
<seg id="28">They were all there and they just did it.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was so phenomenal and made everyone very happy.</seg>
<seg id="30">The family has since set up a fundraising page to "pay it forward" and help other terminally ill people make their dying wishes come true.</seg>
<seg id="31">There are have been nearly $3,000 of contributions to the fund so far.</seg>

<seg id="1">A German historian has found conclusive proof that Nazi Gestapo chief Heinrich Mueller died in the final days of World War II and was buried in a mass grave in a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, the German daily Bild reported Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="2">The research carried out by historian Johannes Tuchel, head of the German Resistance Memorial Center in Berlin, appears to resolve one of the most enduring mysteries of the Nazi era and discredit decades of reported sightings of the secret police chief in Latin America after the war.</seg>
<seg id="3">As head of Adolf Hitler's notorious Gestapo, Mueller played a key role in orchestrating the Holocaust with his oversight of the arrests, deportation and extermination of European Jews.</seg>
<seg id="4">Tuchel was researching a wartime massacre reportedly ordered by Mueller when he came across a death certificate that indicated the Nazi general had been buried near the Luftwaffe headquarters in the final, chaotic days ahead of the May 1945 Allied defeat of the Nazis.</seg>
<seg id="5">The cause of his death was not immediately clear.</seg>
<seg id="6">Mueller's remains and those of others disinterred from the Luftwaffe site, in a part of Berlin that fell under Communist East German rule after the war, were later moved to the Jewish cemetery that had been desecrated by the Nazis and used as a mass grave.</seg>
<seg id="7">Testimony given by the grave digger in 1963 about medals and ribbons on the dead general's uniform provided identifying details that allowed Tuchel to cross-reference the honors with U.S. and German intelligence records, Bild said (paywall link in German).</seg>
<seg id="8">"Mueller's death was registered by the Mitte registry office, with the place of burial being listed as the Jewish cemetery," Tuchel told Bild.</seg>
<seg id="9">But the papers were lost for years, leaving Mueller's fate uncertain after he was last seen in Hitler's bunker on May 1, 1945, the day after the Nazi leader's suicide.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mueller was thought by some to have escaped to Latin America along with thousands of other Nazis, including concentration camp doctor Josef Mengele and mobile gas-chamber architect Walther Rauff.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sightings of the "missing" Gestapo chief were reported from Cuba, Argentina and Czechoslovakia.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mueller was also reported in the early 1950s to have gone to work for East Germany's Stasi secret police force.</seg>
<seg id="13">Tuchel's revelation that Mueller was buried in the Jewish cemetery, which is now a memorial site honoring revered Jewish figures such as philosopher Moses Mendelssohn, was met with revulsion by international Jewish leaders.</seg>
<seg id="14">"It's an insult to the memory of the victims" of the Holocaust, Dieter Graumann, chairman of Germany's Central Council of Jews and vice president of the World Jewish Congress, said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="15">That one of the most brutal Nazi sadists is buried in a Jewish cemetery, of all places, is a terrible iniquity.</seg>

<seg id="2">Bavaria's Christian Social Union has made the toll a pre-condition for joining the coalition that Chancellor Angela Merkel is constructing</seg>
<seg id="3">Brussels has given unexpected backing for a proposed road toll in Germany that would effectively only be charged on foreign drivers.</seg>
<seg id="4">Under the proposal by conservative politicians in the Bavaria region, all cars would face a charge to use motorways, including both German and foreign drivers.</seg>
<seg id="5">But a separate tax on German car owners would be reduced, by the same amount expected to be raised from them by the toll.</seg>
<seg id="6">This means, in effect, that all the new revenue raised by the motorway toll would come from foreign drivers - to be spent on infrastructure projects.</seg>
<seg id="7">Bavaria's Christian Social Union (CSU) has made the toll a pre-condition for joining the coalition that Chancellor Angela Merkel is constructing to rule Germany after the recent elections.</seg>
<seg id="8">But the other parties, including Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), are opposed to the idea - saying it would breach the EU's strict equality laws as it may discriminate against foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="9">But, in a surprise move, the EU's traffic commissioner said the plan might be possible.</seg>
<seg id="10">A separate tax on German car owners would be reduced, by the same amount expected to be raised from them by the toll</seg>
<seg id="11">In a written answer to a question, Commissioner Siim Kallas said a reduction in car tax implemented at the same time as the introduction of a charge on all cars would represent "no discrimination on grounds of nationality."</seg>
<seg id="12">A spokeswoman for the European Commission took a more cautious stance, however, saying there was not yet a "green light" on any future plans for road tolls in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="13">But Ilse Aigner, a CSU member leading coalition negotiations on transport matters, said her party felt vindicated.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Obviously these are signs that it is positive, and that was our view," she said."</seg>
<seg id="15">CSU General-Secretary Alexander Dobrindt was even more forthright.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The car toll for foreigners is coming," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">RBS suspends two forex traders</seg>
<seg id="2">Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders in its foreign exchange division according to two people familiar with the situation, in another sign that the global probe by regulators into the suspected manipulation of the currency market is rapidly gaining traction.</seg>
<seg id="3">Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed they are co-operating with regulators in investigations into the world's largest financial market, where $5.3tn changes hands each day.</seg>
<seg id="4">The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the widening probe that echoes the Libor interbank lending manipulation scandal.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bank, which declined to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it has received requests for information from regulators.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Our ongoing inquiry into this matter continues and we are co-operating fully with the FCA and our other regulators," the bank said two weeks ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">Last month, people close to the situation said that RBS had turned over records of emails and instant messages to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, sent to and from a former trader.</seg>
<seg id="8">This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is understand to have be given leave from his current position as European head of forex spot trading at JPMorgan.</seg>
<seg id="9">Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, went on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currencies trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.</seg>
<seg id="10">None of these traders have been accused of any wrongdoing.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr Usher's instant message group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, people close to the situation said.</seg>
<seg id="12">UBS said this week it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, said it was investigating suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks.</seg>
<seg id="13">At least six authorities globally - the European Commission, Finma, Switzerland's competition authority Weko, the FCA, the Department of Justice in the US and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are looking at allegations that bankers colluded to move the currencies market.</seg>
<seg id="14">HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal probes or received requests for information from regulators, said people familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="15">Banks are scouring through years" worth of instant messages and emails to search for instances of wrongdoing.</seg>
<seg id="16">News about the probes has rattled traders in an area that has been one of the bigger profit drivers of investment banks' trading units in past years but which has been challenged this year as low volatility in currencies cuts opportunities for speculators.</seg>
<seg id="17">Some bankers have tried to play down the affair by saying the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market is almost impossible to manipulate, but senior traders are saying this is not necessarily true.</seg>
<seg id="18">A senior trader said that despite the huge volume of daily foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and banks" increasing use of their own internal platforms meant that "you can start to get an impact on the market at quite small ticket prices."</seg>
<seg id="19">The news came on the same day as Credit Suisse announced it had dismissed a trader at its London exchange traded funds desk this week after he had caused a nearly $6m loss late last year.</seg>
<seg id="20">The bank promptly notified the relevant authorities and has been co-operating with its regulators.</seg>
<seg id="21">"We are confident the trader acted alone and that the matter has been contained," Credit Suisse said.</seg>

<seg id="1">A study aiming to increase the benefits to Scotland of the HS2 rail project has been announced by the UK government.</seg>
<seg id="2">The work by HS2 Ltd suggests high-speed services to Scotland and the north of England will start as soon as Phase One opens in 2026.</seg>
<seg id="3">Transport minister Baroness Kramer said the project would "bring the UK together."</seg>
<seg id="4">Scottish transport minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" to work with the UK government on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="5">Phase One will consist of a new high speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.</seg>
<seg id="6">When Phase Two is completed, lines will run to Manchester and Leeds.</seg>
<seg id="7">In June the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and the North of England from £32.7bn to £42.6bn.</seg>
<seg id="8">The UK government, which has been holding talks with Transport Scotland, has instructed HS2 Ltd to look at further rail capacity and journey time improvements for northern England and Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is to include the possibility of eventual journey times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London of three hours or less.</seg>
<seg id="10">Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is for a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together."</seg>
<seg id="11">We are driving forward HS2 because the benefits it will bring are huge.</seg>
<seg id="12">Without it we face a crisis in capacity on our rail network.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is also about connectivity, across the UK 18 cities including Glasgow and Edinburgh will be better connected because of HS2.</seg>
<seg id="14">Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."</seg>
<seg id="15">For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to "unequivocally" back Scotland's inclusion in the HS2 network.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Brown said: "High speed rail has the potential to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds Scotland's economic weight to the overall case for high speed rail across Britain."</seg>
<seg id="17">So we are excited to work in partnership with the UK Government to examine options for bringing high speed rail to Scotland, creating benefit for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line which the Scottish Government is already planning.</seg>
<seg id="18">I look forward to reviewing the report of the investigation with UK ministers next year and together decide on the next steps.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pawnbrokers shine in Singapore as middle class feel the pinch</seg>
<seg id="2">At a pawnshop in Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga is swapping a gold bangle, ring and pair of earrings to pay her daughters" school fees.</seg>
<seg id="3">"My husband and I have just bought a house so all my money's stuck there," Mrs Amirthalinga says.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though she earns S$3,000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband works as well, the monthly family income is insufficient, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">Indeed, such is demand across parts of southeast Asia - where household debt is rising - that ValueMax, where she is carrying out her transaction, this week became the third pawnshop to list on the Singapore stock exchange.</seg>
<seg id="6">Pawning jewellery is not merely a fast way to land cash - S$1,300 in Ms Amirthalinga's case - but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.</seg>
<seg id="7">Typically pawnbrokers in Singapore charge an effective annual percentage rate of 17 per cent, just above the 15.4 per cent offered at United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, pawnbrokers have the advantage of not requiring credit checks or proof of salary, and can arrange loans faster than banks.</seg>
<seg id="9">Hence millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops as families feel the squeeze from rising living costs and ballooning household and consumer debt.</seg>
<seg id="10">After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fuelled by loose monetary policy in advanced economies, lower- and middle-income families are turning to pawn shops to make up the difference as their economies slow.</seg>
<seg id="11">This week Standard & Poor's, the rating agency, cited increasing household leverage, mainly from rising mortgages, as a risk factor for Asian banks" creditworthiness.</seg>
<seg id="12">It said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt to gross domestic product ratios in Asia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Malaysia topped the list at 80 per cent of GDP, up from 60 per cent in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="14">Economists are also worried about high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week narrowly emerged from technical recession.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Thursday, data showed continued export weakness, and a softening in consumer demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Bottom line is that with costs rising, people in the middle to lower end [of the income scale] will be looking to supplement their income wherever they can," says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.</seg>
<seg id="17">Historically high prices for gold in the past two years have added to the rush to pawn personal belongings, as people take the opportunity to cash in the value of their family jewellery.</seg>
<seg id="18">In Singapore, about 70 per cent of items pawned at the city-state's 200 pawn outlets are gold.</seg>
<seg id="19">People are saying "the gold price looks good, let's pawn grandma's gold chain and get it back next month.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Thailand the largest pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has seen an up to 20 per cent rise in the number of customers using its outlets in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="21">Such is the growth in the pawn business that ValueMax, operator of the outlet at Bendemeer and of 15 others like it in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia - where it has four shops - but outside Asia too, says Yeah Lee Ching, ValueMax's executive director.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company will fund that by using 60 per cent of S$66m it raised this week in a listing on the Singapore stock exchange.</seg>
<seg id="23">While some discount lenders have come under fire for high interest rates, Ms Yeah says that not only does pawning offer cheaper rates than other lenders, it also does not add directly to debt.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Customers are mortgaging items that they already own, and monetising personal assets does not increase household debt," she says.</seg>
<seg id="25">There's an increased social acceptance of pawnbroking as a means to secure short term, secured financing.</seg>
<seg id="26">Nor are the types of people who use pawnbrokers only the financially stretched.</seg>
<seg id="27">Wealthy people in Singapore also use ValueMax outlets, pawning gold bars or Rolex watches, which can command up to 60 per cent of their purchase price in cash.</seg>
<seg id="28">We see customers from all walks of life.</seg>
<seg id="29">"They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow short term for business ventures or investments, or small businesses with a need to tide over their cash flow needs," says Ms Yeah.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sometimes they just need the money very quickly.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Behind-the-scenes support for the attack came from the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) based in central and western Asia," declared the head of the Chinese security services to a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video posted online on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="3">Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Policy Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) made the statement in Tashkent while on an official visit to Uzbekistan.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is the first time that a senior Chinese official has named a specific organisation following the attack on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to Chinese police, three members of one Uighur family from the predominantly Muslim region of Xinjiang, which shares borders with a number of central Asian countries, drove a car loaded with cans of petrol against the entrance of the Forbidden City in Beijing, in a suicide attack that left two dead and 40 injured.</seg>
<seg id="6">The driver of the vehicle, his wife and his mother all died in the fire in the car.</seg>
<seg id="7">ETIM, which is fighting for independence for East Turkestan - the former name of Chinese Xinjiang - was classified by the UNO in 2002 as one of the organisations affiliated with Al-Qaida.</seg>
<seg id="8">The movement is often blamed by Chinese authorities for sporadic trouble in Xinjiang, although many experts cast doubt on its true influence.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Plan to buy Goodyear Amiens will begin with zero employees," Titan CEO says</seg>
<seg id="2">After dramatically throwing in the towel in January over the partial taking over of the Goodyear site in Amiens North, which is due to close, Maurice Taylor, CEO of American tire manufacturer, Titan, now says that he is ready to save 333 of the factory's 1,137 employees.</seg>
<seg id="3">Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of Industrial Recovery, had already announced this on Monday October 21.</seg>
<seg id="4">After giving up the plan to buy the factory in January, today you are back.</seg>
<seg id="5">You had fired violent attacks and insults, talking of 'so-called workers' who 'work three hours' a day, and 'mad' unions, targeting the CGT.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's hard to understand this U-turn.</seg>
<seg id="7">Is this meant to please Mr. Montebourg?</seg>
<seg id="8">I'm not trying to please anyone.</seg>
<seg id="9">Except my wife.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Montebourg is a charming young man who is trying to save some of the best paid industrial jobs.</seg>
<seg id="11">I'm sorry if my words have offended anyone.</seg>
<seg id="12">But there are high levels of tax and unemployment in France too.</seg>
<seg id="13">Does the truth offend you?</seg>
<seg id="14">Working seven hours a day when people in other countries are working eight hours is holding France back.</seg>
<seg id="15">In India, China and many other countries, people work ten to twelve hours a day.</seg>
<seg id="16">But I don't have prejudices about France.</seg>
<seg id="17">What I see is a factory which manufactures good agricultural tires, has good equipment, a good location and plenty of room for growth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Why does Titan need this factory so much?</seg>
<seg id="19">Titan doesn't need to buy this factory.</seg>
<seg id="20">But, if the price is right and the workers are qualified, it's worth trying.</seg>
<seg id="21">What sort of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?</seg>
<seg id="22">If Goodyear had offered the employees a good severance package after announcing that the factory was closing, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.</seg>
<seg id="23">Now, let's imagine that Titan buys a closed factory from Goodyear.</seg>
<seg id="24">At that point, Titan could choose to move the machinery to Poland or any other country in the European Union that still has its own currency.</seg>
<seg id="25">I think Mr. Montebourg knows that.</seg>
<seg id="26">However, he wants to keep the factory in Amiens with at least 333 well-paid employees.</seg>
<seg id="27">Titan has agreed to recruit them from the 1,200 or so people currently working for Goodyear.</seg>
<seg id="28">Also, Mr. Montebourg needs a commitment from Titan before trying to get the CGT to sit down with Goodyear.</seg>
<seg id="29">The first step is for the CGT and Goodyear to seal an agreement on severance pay for all the employees.</seg>
<seg id="30">Then there won't be any employees left in the factory.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr. Montebourg has said that you were prepared to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.</seg>
<seg id="32">Can you confirm that?</seg>
<seg id="33">The only number I mentioned to the minister is 333.</seg>
<seg id="34">I know he would like a four-year guarantee.</seg>
<seg id="35">But, as I said to you, the CGT and Goodyear must first reach an agreement on the severance pay.</seg>
<seg id="36">If all the employees accept it, the project of buying Goodyear Amiens will begin with zero employees.</seg>
<seg id="37">How can we give guarantees on the length of employment when there are no employees left on site?</seg>
<seg id="38">If Mr. Montebourg gets the CGT and Goodyear to reach an agreement and Titan buys the factory, we have every intention of staying in Amiens North for more than four years.</seg>

<seg id="2">In his first game as new UCLA coach on Wednesday night, Steve Alford was received with polite applause by a modest Pauley Pavilion crowd listed at 4,522.</seg>
<seg id="3">By the end of the game, a 96-66 Bruins win over the Cal State San Bernardino Coyotes, the small group of fans applauded Alford with more force.</seg>
<seg id="4">Greeted much more enthusiastically at the start were the returning Jordan Adams, Norman Powell, Kyle Anderson and David Wear, who had all contributed strongly to UCLA's regular-season Pac-12 title a year ago under Ben Howland, who was fired at the end of the season.</seg>
<seg id="5">FOR THE RECORD: UCLA basketball: An earlier version of this story referred to junior guard Norman Powell as a sophomore.</seg>
<seg id="6">Alford showed little emotion when he walked onto the court, which seemed to be haunted the night before Halloween.</seg>
<seg id="7">There was about a 20-minute delay when the lights wouldn't come back on after the player introductions, and then the shot clock didn't work for five seconds.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I thought that was a pretty good trick," Alford said, "turning the lights out and letting the late-arrivers deal with the traffic."</seg>
<seg id="9">Alford also said he was touched that legendary UCLA coach John Wooden's daughter, Nan, was in the stands.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Walking down the hallway from the locker room to the floor, what it means to see all those banners, the numbers of the guys in the [NBA], the retired jerseys, we want our guys to know, when you walk from that locker room to the floor, what you're representing, and it's not just for me," Alford said.</seg>
<seg id="11">It's for them.</seg>
<seg id="12">And to have Nan here, that meant a lot.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Bruins had a 31-18 lead at one point in the first half, but it was cut to 42-39 by halftime.</seg>
<seg id="14">Coyotes freshman Khleem Perkins scored six straight points during one stretch.</seg>
<seg id="15">UCLA (1-0) was led by sophomore guard Adams, who had 25 points and seven rebounds.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Bruins didn't miss Travis Wear, who was out after having surgery to remove his appendix Monday.</seg>
<seg id="17">His twin brother, David, contributed a double-double with 12 points and 13 rebounds.</seg>
<seg id="18">Alford said Travis was expected to be out 2 1/2 to four weeks.</seg>
<seg id="19">Six Bruins finished with double figures in scoring.</seg>
<seg id="20">Junior guard Norman Powell and freshman Zach LaVine each had 15, and UCLA outrebounded Cal State San Bernardino 53-35.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Coyotes (0-1) were led by 17 points from Perkins.</seg>
<seg id="22">Alford's major criticism of his Bruins was of their rebounding.</seg>
<seg id="23">"We have to become a better rebounding team," he said.</seg>

<seg id="7">"While we make every effort to return the hundreds of lost items that are left at Sydney Airport each year, many items remain unclaimed," Sydney Airport general manager corporate affairs Sally Fielke said.</seg>
<seg id="8">The items on offer are as diverse as the airport's 37 million passengers a year - ranging from guitars to gold necklaces - and we hope this year's auction will raise substantial funds for charity.</seg>
<seg id="9">Items to be sold include electronics, sporting equipment, musical instruments, luggage, jewellery, alcohol, cosmetics, toys and clothing.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kangaroos coach Tim Sheens admits Australia face a genuine Rugby League World Cup danger game against an ambitious Fiji in St Helens.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Group A teams meet on Saturday (Sunday morning AEDT), with Australia looking to take their game to the next level after a 28-20 win over England in the tournament opener.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Kangaroos have won all three previous clashes with Fiji by more than 50 points but the Bati have never looked stronger; their squad littered with NRL talent across the park.</seg>
<seg id="5">And while it would be a major surprise if the Kangaroos are seriously troubled, Sheens says Fiji are capable of exploiting any complacency or a lack of focus from his men.</seg>
<seg id="6">"You can't afford to let your guard and get beat," Sheens said as Australia trained in drizzle at the 18,000-capacity Langtree Park on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Realistically, from our point of view, we've got to come out and be aggressive, kick and chase and play what we know is our game.</seg>
<seg id="8">""We'll get our opportunities near their line but we don't want to rush those opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="9">Ireland did that (in an opening 32-14 loss to Fiji)... we're going to have to be a bit more clinical.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Petero Civoniceva-led Fijians were physical and aggressive in their opening match, with Sheens revealing Ireland and Canberra prop Brett White had told Kangaroos players he'd never been so sore after a game.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sheens expects much of the same on what is expected to be a cold, wet night in St Helens.</seg>
<seg id="12">"There'll be the odd tackle that rocks the stadium," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">I think that's what this sort of football is about.</seg>
<seg id="14">""It's been shown with Samoa and New Zealand, and a few of the other games, they've been very high impact.""</seg>
<seg id="15">Sheens predicted debutants Josh Papalii and Boyd Corner would handle the occasion well and backed Daly Cherry-Evans to slot into the side smoothly at halfback in place of the rested Cooper Cronk.</seg>
<seg id="16">Fiji will be without centre Wes Naiqama (back) but they won't be lacking any belief, with tough forward Ashton Sims adamant the 2008 World Cup semi-finalists felt they could pull off what would be the tournament's biggest ever upset.</seg>
<seg id="17">""We're going out there to win, there's no two ways about it," said Sims, one of three Sims brothers in the side."</seg>
<seg id="18">""If there's guys who don't think we can win, I don't really want to play.</seg>
<seg id="19">We've got our backs against the wall big time, I understand that, but most guys don't player rugby league just to be competitive.</seg>
<seg id="20">We want to win.</seg>

<seg id="2">Btitish police served an extradition notice today on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge in Ecuador's embassy in London and requested asylum.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scotland Yard said they had served a "surrender notice" on the 40-year-old Australian requiring him to appear at a police station, adding that failure to do so would make him further liable to arrest.</seg>

<seg id="1">Vatican Polls Parishes on Birth Control, Marriage</seg>
<seg id="2">The Vatican is taking the unusual step of conducting a worldwide survey on how parishes deal with sensitive issues such as birth control, divorce and gay marriage, seeking input ahead of a major meeting on the family that Pope Francis plans next year.</seg>
<seg id="3">The poll was sent in mid-October to every national conference of bishops with a request from the Vatican coordinator, Archbishop Lorenzo Baldisseri, to "share it immediately as widely as possible to deaneries and parishes so that input from local sources can be received."</seg>
<seg id="4">The survey reflects the pope's pledges to move away from what he called a "Vatican-centric" approach toward one where local church leaders are more involved in decision-making.</seg>
<seg id="5">Among the questions are whether gay marriage is recognized in their country and how priests minister to same-sex couples, including how churches can respond when gays seek a religious education or Holy Communion for their children.</seg>
<seg id="6">The poll also asks "how is God's mercy proclaimed" to separated, divorced and remarried couples.</seg>
<seg id="7">Additional information is sought on the pastoral care of men and women who live together outside of marriage.</seg>
<seg id="8">The survey also asks parishes whether they believe married men and women tend to follow church teaching barring the use of artificial contraception.</seg>
<seg id="9">The National Catholic Reporter, an independent news organization, was first to report Thursday that the survey will be conducted, and it posted a copy online.</seg>
<seg id="10">Helen Osman, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops in Washington, confirmed plans for the poll to The Associated Press.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It will be up to each bishop to determine what would be the most useful way of gathering information to provide to Rome," Osman wrote in an email.</seg>
<seg id="12">In England, bishops have posted the survey online to be filled out by a wide range of Catholics, including priests, lay people, parents and nuns.</seg>
<seg id="13">The poll findings will help set the agenda for an extraordinary synod, or meeting, of the presidents of national bishops conferences in October 2014.</seg>
<seg id="14">The introduction to the survey lays out a broad list of concerns which the document says "were unheard of until a few years ago," including single-parent families, polygamy, interfaith marriages and "forms of feminism hostile to the church."</seg>
<seg id="15">Surrogate motherhood is lamented in the document as "wombs for hire," and the survey cites as a new challenge "same-sex unions between persons who are, not infrequently, permitted to adopt children."</seg>
<seg id="16">Francis has said the church needs to do a better job preparing young people for marriage, lamenting that newlyweds seem to think marriage isn't a lifelong commitment but just a "provisional" one.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the same time, he has said the church process for annulling marriages isn't working and must be reviewed.</seg>
<seg id="18">Francis' emphasis on reforming the Vatican bureaucracy and boosting the participation of local church leaders and lay people has prompted speculation about how far-reaching his changes could be.</seg>
<seg id="19">The pope has urged pastors to focus on being merciful and welcoming rather than emphasizing only such divisive issues as abortion, gay marriage and contraception.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, he has made clear his support for traditional marriage and opposition to abortion.</seg>
<seg id="21">The introduction to the new survey extensively quotes former popes and the Catholic catechism on marriage being the union of a man and a woman for the purposes of having children.</seg>
<seg id="22">Baldisseri, secretary general of the Synod of Bishops, wrote in his letter that the meeting next year would be followed by another on the topic in 2015.</seg>

<seg id="1">Police Minister Kim Wells seeking explanation from police chief Ken Lay over petrol thefts</seg>
<seg id="2">The number of people that drive off without paying at Tracey Cook's Geelong petrol station has risen since changes to the way police investigate fuel thefts.</seg>
<seg id="3">POLICE Minister Kim Wells has written to top cop Ken Lay asking for an explanation of its stance on fuel thefts.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Herald Sun has exclusively obtained confidential documents showing the minister is "seeking advice" and "information" from Victoria Police over reports it is no longer investigating complaints about motorists driving off without paying for petrol.</seg>
<seg id="5">The force implemented a new policy from July 1 that it would investigate fuel thefts only if the vehicle in question was stolen, or bearing stolen registration plates, or the registered owner was a known criminal.</seg>
<seg id="6">If no registration plates can be seen, the advice to officers is that no crime should be recorded.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Australian Association of Convenience Stores, which represents more than 1000 service stations across Victoria, is pleading with the State Government to intervene, saying "criminals have been given a green light to steal."</seg>
<seg id="8">The Police Minister's office confirmed he had written to Chief Commissioner Ken Lay last month but had not yet received the advice sought.</seg>
<seg id="9">"In the meantime, this issue remains an operational matter for police," ministerial spokesman Emily Broadbent said.</seg>
<seg id="10">AACS chief Jeff Rogut said police were "going soft" on the problem.</seg>
<seg id="11">"You go into Coles or Woolworths or Myer and steal a lipstick and they will charge you for shoplifting," he said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Yet you can fill up your car with $60 or $70 and drive out at high speed, at potential danger to people, and it's 'Sorry, it's a civil matter'.</seg>
<seg id="13">But Detective Superintendent Kevin Sheridan said the companies were "pushing poor business practices on to police in order to become civil debt collectors."</seg>
<seg id="14">"I receive an email every day on the intelligence reports filed and monitor them closely," he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">If I think any of them need further investigation, I take it up personally with the relevant station manager.</seg>
<seg id="16">The executive director of the Victorian Automobile Chamber of Commerce, David Purchase, said he was aware of petrol drive-offs at one suburban independent site rising from an average of one a week to seven a week since July.</seg>
<seg id="17">On Thursday, APCO service stations successfully sought a court order to obtain from VicRoads the details of 25 registered car owners suspected of stealing $1700 worth of petrol.</seg>
<seg id="18">It claims "desperation" over the police policy shift had forced it to pursue the court order.</seg>
<seg id="19">"In our view this policy is obviously encouraging petrol theft and that's not in the interests of the community," APCO co-director Robert Anderson said.</seg>

<seg id="1">NSA Blames "Internal Error," Not Hackers, For Website Crash</seg>
<seg id="2">The shadowy National Security Agency said late Friday that it was a glitch that brought down its public website for a few hours, not hackers as some claimed online.</seg>
<seg id="3">"NSA.gov was not accessible for several hours tonight because of an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update," the spy agency said in an emailed statement.</seg>
<seg id="4">The issue will be resolved this evening.</seg>
<seg id="5">Claims that the outage was caused by a distributed denial of service [DDoS] attack are not true.</seg>
<seg id="6">Earlier this evening online server trackers noted the NSA's website had been down for at least six hours, and the site continues to be inaccessible for some users.</seg>
<seg id="7">Earlier an NSA spokesperson told ABC News the agency's internal, sensitive network was "not at all" compromised.</seg>
<seg id="8">No classified information is in danger, the spokesperson said.</seg>
<seg id="9">At least one hacktivist group online claimed that they were responsible for bringing down the NSA site with a DDoS attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">DDoS attacks are designed to flood a target website with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.</seg>
<seg id="11">The cyber tactic is a relatively unsophisticated one and the attacks are not meant to penetrate the internal network of the target system.</seg>
<seg id="12">The formerly super secretive NSA, once nicknamed No Such Agency, has found itself in very public light, and amid vicious criticism, in past months following a stream of revelations about is vast foreign and domestic surveillance programs - collectively the product of secret NSA files stolen from the agency and leaked by disenchanted former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.</seg>
<seg id="13">Such growing controversy surrounding the agency prompted early speculation that tonight's incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.</seg>

<seg id="1">Iron ore focus shifts to China's regions</seg>
<seg id="2">RIO Tinto chief executive Sam Walsh has declared China's iron ore appetite is showing no signs of ending, as the regional areas of the world's fastest growing nation start to industrialise.</seg>
<seg id="3">In a speech to the Melbourne Mining Club in Beijing last night, Mr Walsh said it was likely China's next phase of economic growth would come outside the major cities and provinces.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Chinese economy is forecast to grow by at least 7.5 per cent this year, meeting the government's official target.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, it is forecast that country areas of China are still growing by at least 10 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="6">Rio Tinto yesterday marked its 30th anniversary of operating in Beijing by signing a memorandum of understanding to develop new technology with its major shareholder Chinalco, the state-owned mining firm.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr Walsh said he believed there were still international "misconceptions" surrounding China's future economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="8">It (China) is not all skyscrapers and Gucci stores.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are still hundreds of millions of people in the central and western regions who are waiting for modern infrastructure and the urban lifestyle that it supports," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">Meeting those development needs will require more construction, which in turn will require more iron ore, more copper, more bauxite and more energy to power it all.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new Coalition government and Australia's major mining companies have been quick to confirm the China resources boom has yet to end.</seg>
<seg id="12">A new report by the Centre for Independent Studies released this week showed that while China's industrialisation process was well under way, 13 per cent of the population still lived in poverty.</seg>
<seg id="13">A survey in the report showed more than a quarter of the population also believed that their living conditions would improve as the nation's economic development progressed.</seg>
<seg id="14">China is considered Rio Tinto's largest iron ore customer with the miner having sold 1.3 billion tonnes of the commodity to the nation during the past decade.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the speech, Mr Walsh said the miner's relationship with Chinalco should dispel the myths of China's state-owned enterprises held by international investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Chinalco's principal shareholder happens to be a government entity but their corporate goals and motives are largely identical to ours," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">They seek to run a profitable business that is internationally competitive, they worry about safety, sustainability, productivity and costs.</seg>
<seg id="18">There is no hidden agenda, just the same goals and concerns that occupy the directors of any Western companies.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is growing speculation in China that the government will introduce major reforms to break up the monopolies of some SOEs, especially PetroChina, at its national plenum to be held next week.</seg>

<seg id="1">Five years ago, my father passed away.</seg>
<seg id="2">At first, I was in denial about his death. I spoke of him in the present tense.</seg>

<seg id="11">Similarly, her funeral was a cold goodbye focused on the dim light of the candles surrounding her coffin.</seg>
<seg id="12">I thought she had gone.</seg>
<seg id="13">Gradually, by way of tiny and slightly faint or faded appearances during the day and night, she soon came back into my life, evolving as she took back her place in the landscape of my mind which thought it was still in mourning.</seg>
<seg id="14">And then she revealed herself by showing me aspects of myself I had never seen before, that were hidden by my relationship with her.</seg>
<seg id="15">Thus, I learnt and understood that I had not lost my mother herself at all, just a woman that I did not know very well, a woman who embodied her during her stay on this earth.</seg>
<seg id="16">In dying, this woman had completed her life and freed the person that I loved, and now she was back, whole and complete.</seg>
<seg id="17">This detour in the path of my life is still the most unexpected and beautiful thing.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is a privilege to know that the people we love never leave us.</seg>
<seg id="19">I am like my father, "inside and out", it seems.</seg>
<seg id="20">I have always been told that.</seg>
<seg id="21">I never believed it at the time.</seg>
<seg id="22">I had a difficult relationship with him until he became old and ill.</seg>
<seg id="23">At that point I was no longer afraid of him and I was able to love him.</seg>
<seg id="24">One day, he died.</seg>
<seg id="25">For a long time, he stayed with me - when I stopped smoking, when I was afraid, when I was ill...</seg>
<seg id="26">He would speak to me, constantly encourage me, he lived in my body.</seg>
<seg id="27">I would see his hands when I looked at mine; I lent him my body.</seg>
<seg id="28">But this was never indiscreet.</seg>
<seg id="29">I could still lead a personal life.</seg>
<seg id="30">He allowed me my privacy.</seg>
<seg id="31">That lasted a long time, then one day he was gone.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the end, it felt comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.</seg>
<seg id="33">I don't know who it was that said that those who die are not forgotten but invisible.</seg>
<seg id="34">My parents are no longer here but I feel them close to me constantly.</seg>
<seg id="35">In every event, every moment of my life, I feel their presence, and I am always referring to them: what would they say, what would they think, what would they do?</seg>
<seg id="36">I constantly dream of them, perhaps not every night, but several times a week for sure.</seg>
<seg id="37">I often dream of the last moments I shared with them before it was too late, except that there is still one thing that prevents me from enjoying the moment.</seg>
<seg id="38">I often wake up distressed because it hits me and I feel their absence deeply.</seg>
<seg id="39">Sometimes, some dreams affect me differently and make an impression on my mind, so, in effect, they continue to live and be a part of my life.</seg>
<seg id="40">On the day before my ultrasound, when I was going to find out the gender of my baby, I dreamt that I woke up and hauled myself out of bed, and my father was waiting for me on the landing. He was smiling at me and was happy that I was expecting a little boy.</seg>
<seg id="41">The following day, I had the feeling that he had come to visit me in my dream to tell me that he was sharing the joy I was feeling.</seg>
<seg id="42">And, yes, I was indeed carrying a boy.</seg>
<seg id="43">I loved sharing that moment with him and enjoy talking of that shared memory that happened after his death.</seg>
<seg id="44">Exactly five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="45">One year previously, she had travelled with my family to Cuba.</seg>
<seg id="46">Hence the shock that her loss provoked in the young graduate I was then.</seg>
<seg id="47">In spite of everything, I said my goodbyes fairly quickly.</seg>
<seg id="48">But she continues to influence my life, particularly in when I'm going through hard times, or when I have to make an important decision.</seg>
<seg id="49">Deciding to learn Arabic and pursuing an interest in the Middle East, to the point of doing a Masters at a major university, in hindsight, were not trivial decisions.</seg>
<seg id="50">Actually, I often used to listen to her speak Arabic during my childhood and talk about Morocco where she had lived for decades before coming back to France when it became independent.</seg>
<seg id="51">The values she instilled in me are still there, so I often end up wondering what she would want me to do at a given moment.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's the same with my opinions: I try to live up to the generosity and correctness of her mind as a fervent believer.</seg>
<seg id="53">Nowadays I feel her as a daily presence, a benevolent force, a saving spirit.</seg>
<seg id="54">I see her eyes resting on me.</seg>
<seg id="55">My mother died nineteen years ago now.</seg>
<seg id="56">She died after talking to me on the telephone.</seg>
<seg id="57">I went through all the stages: incomprehension, anger, grief, tears that would come on their own, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, at incongruous moments.</seg>
<seg id="58">But time eased the pain.</seg>
<seg id="59">Now there is just the gap, the silent emptiness, the need for her to entrust me, to reassure me in the palm of her gentleness.</seg>
<seg id="60">Yet, she is there, a silent presence, watching me.</seg>
<seg id="61">Every morning I see her worried eyes looking at me, I see the dark rings giving her a burdened look, the wrinkles around the lips dug by cigarettes, the lines that mark the forehead on days of worry.</seg>
<seg id="62">My mother has taken possession of my face, and every morning she looks back at me in the mirror.</seg>
<seg id="63">And every morning, I look away.</seg>
<seg id="64">My wife and the mother of my three children died of cancer at 43.</seg>
<seg id="65">We always feel her protecting us, nothing bad will happen to us.</seg>
<seg id="66">This was her promise on her death bed; so, gradually, we learnt to smile again, and saying her name is no longer taboo but a comfort.</seg>
<seg id="67">Of course, I talk to her at the dead of night when the absence hurts too much, and she comes into my dreams when my spirits are a little low.</seg>
<seg id="68">We feel supported and protected in difficult moments, and the passage of time has made us realise that she was the conductor, with us trying to stay on the path she had drawn for us.</seg>
<seg id="69">If somebody truly loved you, their absence cannot tear them out your heart or your memories.</seg>
<seg id="70">In a way, the person you loved becomes your inner energy.</seg>
<seg id="71">I lost my father on 22 August 2008 to asbestos-related cancer.</seg>
<seg id="72">I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he would have thought or would have appreciated.</seg>
<seg id="73">I was unable to attend his burial, and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a little boy.</seg>
<seg id="74">Sometimes my beliefs are different from his, so I am always asking myself if what I am doing conforms with his way of seeing things.</seg>
<seg id="75">I have even had problems at work because of these convictions.</seg>
<seg id="76">However, I can't do otherwise; I lose sleep and constantly ask myself what he would think.</seg>
<seg id="77">I don't know if I have adopted his way of thinking or if I am simply like him - is it genetic?</seg>
<seg id="78">Whatever the case, he will always be my point of reference.</seg>
<seg id="79">He was a bit like an alter ego, we didn't even need to speak.</seg>
<seg id="80">In short, he is there every day.</seg>
<seg id="81">I feel his presence and it makes me happy.</seg>
<seg id="82">Almost thirty years ago, my husband died aged 33.</seg>
<seg id="83">I was 28 and our son was 6.</seg>
<seg id="84">The immense pain that engulfed me has eased of course, but he is still close to me.</seg>
<seg id="85">He very often "turns up" in my dreams, in a very specific way, so vivid that when I wake up I am sad again when I realise that it was just a dream.</seg>
<seg id="86">The other night, he asked me how I was; I said not good, and he said "I'm coming down", but in a voice so real that I woke up with a start, upset, and I switched on the bedside lamp and looked around, convinced that he would come.</seg>
<seg id="87">I still live in the same house and, frequently, I feel he is watching me; I turn round and see he isn't there, but I know it's him and I talk to him.</seg>
<seg id="88">I feel his presence in every room and it makes me happy.</seg>
<seg id="89">I wouldn't leave this house for anything in the world. We were happy here and his spirit lives here with me.</seg>
<seg id="90">I'm 58 and I have always lived alone since losing him. He is and will remain the love of my life.</seg>
<seg id="91">I should say that I am rather sociable and have a job with responsibilities. I laugh and sing, I go out, I'm a grandmother, I have lots of friends, but my heart and my soul belong to him. I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.</seg>

<seg id="1">David Bowie: Four Unpublished Songs Released</seg>
<seg id="2">The British musician is full of surprises this year.</seg>
<seg id="3">Following The Next Day, released in January, he has put together a deluxe re-release planned for November 04, featuring several unpublished tracks.</seg>
<seg id="4">Four have already appeared on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="5">The announcement that David Bowie was releasing a new album had stunned the world.</seg>
<seg id="6">On 08 January 2013, the date of his 66th birthday, he announced that a new album would be released in March.</seg>
<seg id="7">After ten years of silence (his last record, Reality, was released in 2003) and very few public appearances, the British musician proved that he could still light up the pop scene.</seg>
<seg id="8">A feast for fans</seg>
<seg id="9">Not tired of making surprises, David Bowie had more than one trick up his sleeves with The Next Day:</seg>
<seg id="10">the Thin White Duke was also planning to re-release the album on November 04.</seg>
<seg id="11">He put together a real feast for his fans to mark the occasion.</seg>
<seg id="12">This re-release, titled The Next Day Extra, was presented in the form of three disks: the original album, unpublished studio sessions and remixes, plus a DVD containing the four clips that have already been unveiled.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Next Day Extra had a total of ten additional tracks compared to the original album: the three songs from the Deluxe edition, five songs specially unveiled for the occasion, and two remixes.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moreover, David Bowie has introduced this fine box-set through a video.</seg>
<seg id="15">In it, he presents each of the disks plus the accessories provided with them: exclusive photos and sleeves, a notebook for sharing your own impressions, a booklet of lyrics etc.</seg>
<seg id="16">And finally, he gives a teaser to his new track, Atomica, which is typically in the style of The Next Day, with very prominent guitars and skillfully controlled rock electrics.</seg>
<seg id="17">Previously Unpublished Tracks Released</seg>
<seg id="18">However, Atomica is not the only track to have been released.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Informer, Like A Rocket Man and Born In A UFO are also available on the net.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Informer is double-edged - an unsettling intro followed by a brilliant rush of sound that progressively slows down to make way for a pop ballad.</seg>
<seg id="21">Was Bowie trying to make a reference to Elton John's Rocket Man, or even Gravity, in his Like A Rocket Man?</seg>
<seg id="22">Either way, with this cheerful track, the singer seems to be in his element when his feet are no longer on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="23">Space Oddity, by comparison, was much more solemn.</seg>
<seg id="24">On Born in a UFO, David Bowie once again refers to his strangeness: could he have come from another planet?</seg>
<seg id="25">The spellbinding guitar riffs make you want to leave Earth.</seg>
<seg id="26">In any case, Bowie enjoys playing the chameleon in these tracks: in turn, an informer, a rocket man, possibly a Martian...</seg>
<seg id="27">He veils and reveals at the same time, and likes to take on different personalities, as he has throughout his career, most notably with his personas: Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is therefore not surprising that he should be holding a mask in the promotional photography for L'Invitation au Voyage, by Louis Vuitton, of which he is the new face.</seg>
<seg id="29">He appears in one of their adverts, broadcast from November 10.</seg>

<seg id="3">WHILE they claim they are the best of mates with their feet "firmly on the ground," behind the scenes One Direction members are squabbling like school boys with diva demands.</seg>
<seg id="4">It appears things could be unravelling for the English-Irish boy band, with Melbourne sources saying the lads were throwing hissy fits before departing Australia, as they continue their Take Me Home Tour.</seg>
<seg id="5">Despite appearing as tight as ever and all about the fans during their recent Melbourne gigs, the real show is backstage with the pop sensations reportedly at loggerheads.</seg>
<seg id="6">An aviation source said things were so bad after their final Melbourne concert last week, one of the boys flatly refused to travel with the rest of the band as they departed Australia from Melbourne to Narita, for the Japanese leg of their sell out world tour.</seg>
<seg id="7">Instead the band member chartered his own luxury jet, costing about a cool $200,000, with the rest of the band flying out on their own luxury aircraft costing about $250,000.</seg>
<seg id="8">``It seems the boys were unable to patch things up, with one simply refusing to travel with the rest of the band," the source, who wished not to be named, said.</seg>
<seg id="9">And forget the fans.</seg>
<seg id="10">When asked if the boys could sign some memorabilia for some of the airline staff's family the boys' management flatly said ``no under any circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="11">Confidential sought comment from One Direction's Australian tour promoter Sony Music, who said "no comment."</seg>

<seg id="1">Scientists proud of dark matter study that turns up nothing</seg>
<seg id="2">(UPI) -- Scientists at the Homestake Gold Mine in South Dakota running the biggest, most sensitive dark matter detector yet released its first round of results yesterday -- and they found nothing.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Large Underground Xenon dark matter experiment, or LUX, consists of a vat of 368 kilograms of liquid xenon to minus 110 degrees Celsius, surrounded by a tank of water.</seg>
<seg id="4">LUX sits 4,850 feet underground at the old mine, shielded from cosmic rays.</seg>
<seg id="5">An international team of researchers watched for three months to see if any WIMPS -- weakly interacting massive particles -- would pass through the rock and reveal themselves by interacting with the xenon, as predicted by previous experiments.</seg>
<seg id="6">But they discovered nothing -- and scientists on the team are proud of how little they saw.</seg>
<seg id="7">"In 25 years of searching, this is the cleanest signal I've seen," said Richard Gaitskell, physicist and researcher on the team.</seg>
<seg id="8">The discovery of nothing is significant in that, if confirmed, it would rule out one theory about dark matter, which astronomers have said makes up a quarter of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="9">So far scientists are more clear on what dark matter isn't, rather than what it is, and now they know it isn't high-mass WIMPS, as LUX should have detected more than a thousand such particles.</seg>
<seg id="10">The LUX experiment will run through all of next year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Researchers will next move to add another factor of sensitivity to the device, and run the experiment again.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Just because we don't see anything in the first run doesn't mean we won't see anything in the second," Gaitskell said.</seg>

<seg id="1">In Reversal, Court Allows Texas Law On Abortion</seg>
<seg id="2">Only three days after a federal judge blocked a new Texas law that threatened to shut down many of the state's abortion clinics, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, reversed the decision, saying the rule should take effect while the case is argued in the months to come.</seg>
<seg id="3">Abortion clinic owners and women's health advocates said the decision would have catastrophic effects because as many as 13 of the 36 clinics providing abortions in the state would have to stop doing so immediately, forcing women in large swaths of Texas to travel several hours on multiple days to obtain abortions.</seg>
<seg id="4">The clinics forced to halt abortions have been unable to satisfy a new requirement, part of a broader anti-abortion law adopted in July, that doctors performing the procedure must have formal admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic.</seg>
<seg id="5">Greg Abbott, the state attorney general and a Republican candidate for governor next year, filed an emergency appeal to the three-judge circuit court on Monday asking it to overrule the lower court.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said in a statement Thursday, "This unanimous decision is a vindication of the careful deliberation by the Texas Legislature to craft a law to protect the health and safety of Texas women."</seg>
<seg id="7">Gov. Rick Perry, who has said he hopes to abolish abortion in Texas, said in a statement, "Today's decision affirms our right to protect both the unborn and the health of the women of Texas."</seg>
<seg id="8">In blocking the requirement on Monday, Judge Lee Yeakel of United States District Court in Austin accepted the argument of the clinics, and many doctors and national medical associations, that requiring admitting privileges had no bearing on safety because in the rare event of an emergency, patients will be rushed to the nearest hospital and treated the same way regardless.</seg>
<seg id="9">The requirement is likely to be unconstitutional, he declared, because it is "without a rational basis and places a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion."</seg>
<seg id="10">But the appeals panel found just the opposite: that the rule is likely to be constitutional because it serves a legitimate state interest in regulating doctors and does not impose an "undue burden" on the right to abortion.</seg>
<seg id="11">The appeals court said that the admitting privilege rule might "increase the cost of accessing an abortion provider and decrease the number of physicians available to perform abortions."</seg>
<seg id="12">But it cited a Supreme Court statement in an earlier abortion case that if a regulation serves a valid purpose, the fact that it has "the incidental effect of making it more difficult or more expensive to procure an abortion cannot be enough to invalidate it."</seg>
<seg id="13">In Texas and other states, especially in smaller cities and rural areas, abortion clinics often use visiting doctors who may be highly qualified but do not meet the rules of local hospitals for admitting privileges.</seg>
<seg id="14">Many hospitals, for example, grant privileges only to doctors who admit a certain number of patients a year, while emergency hospitalizations after abortions are rare.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some hospitals are unwilling to make formal arrangements with abortion providers because of religious reasons or because they fear protests.</seg>
<seg id="16">The challenge to the admitting privilege rule was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, the Center for Reproductive Rights, Planned Parenthood and other abortion clinic owners in Texas.</seg>
<seg id="17">They were apparently surprised by the sudden turn and warned of dire consequences.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We believe there are currently 36 health centers in Texas that provide abortions, and one-third will be forced to stop those services tomorrow," Amanda Harrington, a spokeswoman for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="19">Four of 13 Planned Parenthood clinics in Texas have not been able to find doctors with local admitting privileges and will halt abortions immediately, but they will remain open to provide other women's services, Ms. Harrington said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some other private clinics may shut down, mostly in West Texas.</seg>
<seg id="21">Courts in Alabama, Mississippi, North Dakota and Wisconsin have temporarily blocked similar admitting-privilege requirements as unconstitutional obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="22">With Thursday's ruling by the Fifth Circuit, it appeared likely that the issue will eventually be decided by the Supreme Court, part of the continuing battles over how much states may restrict the right to abortion granted by Roe v. Wade in 1973.</seg>

<seg id="1">Former Ports Minister Joe Tripodi turns from witness to the subject of ICAC investigation in Circular Quay inquiry</seg>
<seg id="2">Former ALP powerbroker Joe Tripodi fronts the ICAC today.</seg>
<seg id="3">Picture: Ross Schultz Source: News Limited</seg>
<seg id="4">JOE Tripodi, now officially under the corruption watchdog's microscope, says he "didn't like" a change in policy for Circular Quay that ultimately benefited his "mentor" Eddie Obeid.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr Tripodi, who walked into the headquarters of the corruption watchdog this morning to quickly learn he was now officially under investigation for misconduct in public office, denied telling a former staff member that Eddie Obeid had leases at Circular Quay.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said he had discussions with Obeid, who the inquiry heard was "his mentor," about the policy and that the former Labor powerbroker told him he was adopting too "academic" an approach "to the marketplace."</seg>
<seg id="7">"He thought, when it came to this particular policy, I had no sense of the reality of the business world," he said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Ex-ALP heavyweight Joe Tripodi has been drawn into ICAC inquiry dealing with Eddie Obeid's Circular key businesses.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Obeid is being investigation by the Independent Commission against Corruption over claims he misused his position as an MP to lobby four consecutive ports ministers about the Circular Quay retail leases, where his family had a secret interest.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr Tripodi denied the evidence sensationally heard yesterday from his former deputy chief of staff Lynne Ashpole that he told her Eddie "wasn't too happy" about the plan to put the Circular Quay leases out to public tender.</seg>
<seg id="11">"No, I (didn't say that)," he said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mr Obeid complained about the treatment leaseholders were receiving and was of the view they should be reissued the leases.</seg>
<seg id="13">The inquiry heard suggestions Mr Obeid knew about changes to the policy as they unfolded, up until the point the decision was made to keep the leases as direct negotiations with present leaseholders.</seg>
<seg id="14">Reporters crowd Joe Tripodi as he makes his way into the ICAC inquiry.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Unequivocally I was not discussing the development of this policy with Mr Obeid," Mr Tripodi said.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have to listen to the industry....and I changed the policy.</seg>
<seg id="17">I didn't like it but given the weight of industry pressure and urging I accepted this change was the appropriate policy for the government.</seg>
<seg id="18">He agreed he met with mediator Paul Scanlan about the commercial lease agreement but denied he'd readily expressed an opinion the public tender wouldn't go ahead.</seg>
<seg id="19">"I think he has imagined the amount of inspiration he received from that meeting," he said.</seg>
<seg id="20">The inquiry continues.</seg>

<seg id="1">A team of biologists working for the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York has identified a new humpback dolphin species living off the northern coast of Australia.</seg>
<seg id="2">Thibaut Bouveroux, in charge of the scientific mission at the Observatoire pour la Conservation et l'Etude des Animaux et Milieux Marins (OCEAMM), discussed this discovery with L'Express and explains the long process of identifying new species.</seg>
<seg id="3">Did the discovery of this new humpback dolphin species surprise you?</seg>
<seg id="4">It's good news, but it didn't surprise me especially.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the past, species have been described and identified on the basis of morphology, anatomy and geography. Today, the development of new tools such as genetics enables us to improve our knowledge of the science of the classification of species.</seg>
<seg id="6">Moreover, there is a possibility that these advances in genetics and molecular biology may call into question the classification or belonging of a species to a particular genus, family or even order.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals on the basis of the morphological differences between species.</seg>
<seg id="8">Today, some of these classifications have been questioned as a result of advances in genetics.</seg>
<seg id="9">Likewise, two species that are very similar in morphology were distinguished using genetics.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is the case with the new species that has just been identified.</seg>
<seg id="11">About a decade ago, scientists recognised two species that belonged to this sub-family: Pacific humpback dolphins and Atlantic humpback whales.</seg>
<seg id="12">Recent analyses have enabled four species to be distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="13">Why is this a significant discovery as the Wildlife Conservation Society says?</seg>
<seg id="14">From the point of view of conservation, it is essential to be aware of genetic differences so a species and, thus, its genetic variability can be protected.</seg>
<seg id="15">Researchers have known about this population for a long time, but they did not know that it was part of a new species that only lives in this location.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hence, in the event of large-scale mortality in the region, caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture, we would know that we are dealing with the extinction of a species rather than the local disappearance of a population belonging to a much more widespread species.</seg>
<seg id="17">Such loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.</seg>
<seg id="18">A species is considered to be threatened or endangered based on the number of its members alive on the planet, known as the stock, and of the possibility of the species restoring itself using neighbouring stocks.</seg>
<seg id="19">The stock of the Sousa Chinensis species, from which the newly discovered population derives, has automatically grown weaker, making it more vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="20">Why is it rare to discover new marine mammal species?</seg>
<seg id="21">Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.</seg>
<seg id="22">They live in homogeneous, open habitats, in which there are numerous genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.</seg>
<seg id="23">This blending of genes limits the creation of new species.</seg>
<seg id="24">On the other hand, more enclosed ecosystems favour genetic isolation, which can ultimately lead to the creation of new species.</seg>
<seg id="25">It should be noted that the marine environment is the least known of environments.</seg>
<seg id="26">We prefer sending robots to Mars rather than knowing what is living in the Mariana Trench, just 11 kilometres below the surface of the ocean.</seg>
<seg id="27">More money is spent on the search for life on other planets than on marine research, and it is high time things changed.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Royal Bank of Scotland will create an internal bad bank structure to cover £38 billion (€45,000 million) of its highest risk assets, a step designed to improve its relations with the City and accelerate its re-privatisation.</seg>
<seg id="2">The bank wants to reduce the proportion of toxic assets on its books from 55% to 70% over the next two years and hopes to clean them up completely in three years.</seg>
<seg id="3">RBS has also said that it will be writing down a provision of £4 500 million for the depreciation of additional bad debts for the quarter, an entry related to the setting up of the hive-off structure.</seg>
<seg id="4">RBS has also specified that this internal restructuring would release £10-11 000 million in capital, thus strengthening its lending ability.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bank and the City have stressed that the "bad bank" would enable a break-off from the past, government in particular having been accused of interfering in the management of RBS.</seg>

<seg id="1">Parents of Intersex Kids Can Pick 'Gender Undetermined'</seg>
<seg id="2">Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third gender for babies born with ambiguous genitalia.</seg>
<seg id="3">No longer will newborns be rigidly assigned to male or female.</seg>
<seg id="4">The new law doesn't require parents to declare any gender for such children, allowing parents to declare gender "undetermined" or "unspecified" on their birth certificates.</seg>
<seg id="5">The aim of the law was to take the pressure off parents who might make hasty decisions on sex-assignment surgery for newborns, and to fight discrimination against those who are intersex.</seg>
<seg id="6">One intersex person, according to the BBC, said years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman."</seg>
<seg id="7">I will remain the patchwork created by doctors, bruised and scarred.</seg>
<seg id="8">An estimated one in 2,000 children born each year is neither boy nor girl.</seg>
<seg id="9">They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions that fall under the diagnosis of disorders of sexual development, an umbrella term for those with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes), or unusually developed genitalia.</seg>
<seg id="10">Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gender identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it's better to use the best available information to assign it then to wait and monitor the child's psychological and physical development before undertaking surgery, if at all.</seg>
<seg id="12">New York City psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in issues of gender identification, said the new German law "sounds like a good thing."</seg>
<seg id="13">Intersex children pose ethical dilemma.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Some people have life-endangering conditions that require surgery, but most kids do not," he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">You can make a gender assignment without surgery, and then see how identity develops.</seg>
<seg id="16">The science of knowing how a child will develop any gender identity is not very accurate.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nobody can answer the questions about why this happens.</seg>
<seg id="18">It's like the mystery of why people are gay.</seg>
<seg id="19">A report filed to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people, as their status is not gender related but instead relates to their biological makeup, which is neither exclusively male nor exclusively female, but is typical of both at once or not clearly defined as either.</seg>
<seg id="20">These features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breasts and stature; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia; or in chromosomal structures and hormones.</seg>
<seg id="21">The report also gives an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in the realm of employment, as well as levels of harassment, violence and bias crimes.</seg>
<seg id="22">Gender nonconforming boys now have special camp.</seg>
<seg id="23">Already, Australia and Nepal allow adults to mark male, female or a "third gender" on their official documents.</seg>
<seg id="24">In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the world's first recognized "genderless" person after winning a legal appeal to keep an "unspecified" gender status for life.</seg>
<seg id="25">German passports will have a third designation other than M or F -- X, for intersex, according to the Interior Ministry.</seg>
<seg id="26">In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.</seg>
<seg id="27">In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from that strongly Catholic country signed a petition for "gender theory" to be withdrawn from school textbooks.</seg>
<seg id="28">The U.S. website Catholic Online has also opposed the German law, writing that "as the world is being dragged into a new state, where gender is a choice, but sexual activity is not, we reverse two more pillars of civilization."</seg>
<seg id="29">One Maryland mother of a newborn also told the Baby Zone that she would rather see babies assigned gender at birth.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Parenting is stressful enough without extra limitations, especially if you don't know the gender of your child," she told the parenting website.</seg>
<seg id="31">Children need stability and certainty.</seg>
<seg id="32">Historically, children born with both male and female genitalia were called hermaphrodites, named for the handsome Greek god who had dual sexuality.</seg>
<seg id="33">And as little as a decade ago, the medical community thought of gender as a slate that could be erased and then redrawn.</seg>
<seg id="34">But now, many are challenging the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors can sometimes get it wrong, not knowing how a child will feel about their gender assignment when they grow up.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Back in the middle of the 20th century, it was called a 'psychiatric emergency,'" said Drescher.</seg>
<seg id="36">When these kids were born, you didn't call the psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.</seg>
<seg id="37">The prevailing theory on how to treat children with ambiguous genitalia was put forward by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held that gender was malleable.</seg>
<seg id="38">He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental cues -- how parents raised a child -- interacted with a child's genes and hormones to shape whether the person identified as male or female.</seg>
<seg id="39">But in one 1966 case, known as "John/Joan," his theories became controversial.</seg>
<seg id="40">He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been severed in a botched circumcision to have the child fully castrated, removing his testicles, as well, and to raise him as a girl.</seg>
<seg id="41">"Money presented the case as a successful case of transition, but it was not," said Drescher.</seg>
<seg id="42">When the boy was around 15, he transitioned back to a boy and married a woman.</seg>
<seg id="43">But at 38, he committed suicide.</seg>
<seg id="44">Drescher said that now some doctors are still "practicing that model."</seg>
<seg id="45">But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these gender surgeries have come forward "not happy with the outcome."</seg>
<seg id="46">Such was the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous genitals.</seg>
<seg id="47">Doctors couldn't be sure if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced he could never live a "satisfactory life" as a man.</seg>
<seg id="48">So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external organ and testes were surgically removed and he was raised as a girl.</seg>
<seg id="49">He was given female hormones at age 12.</seg>
<seg id="50">"I knew that I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.</seg>
<seg id="51">I was unhappy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="52">At 18, he was set for a vaginoplasty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But depressed and knowing something was wrong, he demanded medical records.</seg>
<seg id="54">What he found out was horrifying.</seg>
<seg id="55">I was sterilized at birth -- and no one ever told me.</seg>
<seg id="56">Bruce was born with a DSD that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone to properly develop his genitals.</seg>
<seg id="57">After learning the truth, he changed back to a man, taking testosterone shots and having his breasts removed.</seg>
<seg id="58">Surgery rendered him infertile.</seg>
<seg id="59">Today, he advocates for others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to normalize perceptions of those who are intersex.</seg>
<seg id="60">But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director for California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that the German law "invites labeling and stigma."</seg>
<seg id="61">"A lot of activists are concerned that what the German rule will do is encourage parents to make quick decisions and give the child an 'undetermined,'" she said.</seg>
<seg id="62">We are afraid it will encourage intervention.</seg>
<seg id="63">We think a better process is assigning male or female sex, then waiting.</seg>
<seg id="64">But we haven't seen how the law will play out, so all we can do is speculate.</seg>
<seg id="65">Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be recognized in a third gender."</seg>
<seg id="66">"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender," she said.</seg>
<seg id="67">German law is about assigning it at birth.</seg>
<seg id="68">That is not a battle young children should have to take up at this point.</seg>
<seg id="69">When they are grown, they can make decisions about their own bodies.</seg>
<seg id="70">But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh breast radiologist who has a daughter with a disorder of sexual development and helps hundreds of others in a support group, said the German law will "empower" both parents and children.</seg>
<seg id="71">Baratz's daughter Katie was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="72">Because her androgen receptors are faulty, Katie developed female characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="73">She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.</seg>
<seg id="74">Now at 29, Katie is married and at the University of Pennsylvania, a resident in child psychiatry.</seg>
<seg id="75">Though she is infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy.</seg>
<seg id="76">"The law gives parents some space not to have to rush into making decisions themselves," said Baratz.</seg>
<seg id="77">It gives them the time to do some tests and figure it out and a period of time before they write 'male' or 'female.'</seg>
<seg id="78">This way, you are OK -- raise the child, love the child.</seg>
<seg id="79">You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the fun.</seg>
<seg id="80">We don't have to rush into surgery that is irreversible.</seg>
<seg id="81">"It brings the children into the decision and takes away the anxiety that motivates parents because they don't feel they are doing the right thing," she said.</seg>
<seg id="82">Ultimately, the child will decide which sex he or she feels more comfortable with -- and that's a wonderful thing.</seg>
<seg id="83">It empowers children to make the decision for themselves.</seg>

<seg id="1">Two YMCA employees charged with sex offences before allegations against Jonathan Lord, Royal Commission hears</seg>
<seg id="2">Two YMCA NSW employees had been charged with child sex offences before allegations were raised against Caringbah child care worker Jonathan Lord in 2011, the child sexual abuse Royal Commission has heard.</seg>
<seg id="3">But in its opening statement to the Commission it said it had "never dealt with an incident of child sexual assault within its organisation," the Commission was told.</seg>
<seg id="4">Chief executive officer Phillip Hare was asked about one case where a YMCA employee was charged child pornography offences, and another when a gym instructor at the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of child sexual offences against children in his care in 1991.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr Hare told Gail Furness, counsel assisting the Commission, he knew about the first case but did not know about the second one.</seg>
<seg id="6">He conceded the YMCA's opening statement to the commission was also inaccurate in claiming "there have been external audits of the YMCA that have recognised the YMCA as being at the forefront of child safety."</seg>
<seg id="7">Evidence before the commission is that YMCA was notified that it received the second lowest of four possible ratings in a Department of Education and Communities quality audit in August this year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr Hare, who started with the YMCA when he was 21, conceded management "from myself down" failed by recruiting Lord and failed to make sure staff were clear about their obligations to report child safe policy breaches.</seg>
<seg id="9">Earlier this year Lord was convicted for sexual offences against 12 boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was jailed for a minimum of six years.</seg>
<seg id="11">But Mr Hare rejected the suggestion the YMCA had a cultural problem which prevented staff from reporting Lord's breaches of child safety.</seg>
<seg id="12">Staff gave evidence they observed breaches including Lord being alone with children, babysitting them privately, having them sit on his lap, saying he loved one and letting them play with his mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="13">Danielle Ockwell, who was supervised by Lord and asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behaviour, testified she found the YMCA Caringbah children's services manager Jacqui Barnat who supervised Lord "very intimidating and hard to approach a lot of the time."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CEO said he did not accept staff's evidence that they were uncomfortable with reporting upwards to their managers.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rather, he said, their friendships with Lord clouded their judgements about reporting him.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Hare said he had provided his view to the YMCA NSW board that the lesson for the organisation from the "Jonathan Lord incident" was "not about reporting" by staff, and the board agreed with him.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Hare said the decision to get staff to sign confidentiality agreements soon after the allegations emerged was made by YMCA general manager of children's services Liam Whitley.</seg>
<seg id="18">He said it was intended to avoid contamination of evidence but was "overzealous" and poorly executed.</seg>
<seg id="19">YMCA NSW was not a child safe organisation at the time Jonathan Lord was employed between 2009 and 2011, child sex abuse expert Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the commission.</seg>
<seg id="20">He said there were "serious problems" in recruitment, screening, induction, training and supervision of staff.</seg>
<seg id="21">The hearing adjourned until December 20.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why The Deep Web Has Washington Worried</seg>
<seg id="2">Washington has no idea what to make of the Dread Pirate Roberts.</seg>
<seg id="3">As Lev Grossman and I write in this week's cover story, the Dread Pirate Roberts allegedly ran the Silk Road, the world's most successful online drug bazaar, until the feds caught him earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="4">His real name, according to a 39-page federal complaint against him, is Ross Ulbricht, 29.</seg>
<seg id="5">He supposedly took the pseudonym from a character in the movie and book, The Princess Bride.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the Silk Road, DPR, as his followers called him, created a business model for anyone wanting to sell illicit items online using free encryption software called Tor and the virtually anonymous crypto-currency Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="7">Though the feds have taken Silk Road offline, there are plenty of folks lining up to be the next Dread Pirate Roberts.</seg>
<seg id="8">Lev and I examine the greater implications of the Deep Web, the massive and growing anonymous area of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="9">But from the perspective of lawmakers and law enforcement in Washington, Silk Road presents a double conundrum.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's a blueprint for criminals the world over at a time when FBI resources are stretched thin and political will to empower government snooping has cratered.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it has created a regulatory headache in figuring how to deal with whole new currencies, tax havens and virtual online markets.</seg>
<seg id="12">While Tor is used by everyone from law enforcement to Syrian dissidents to protect valuable information, it is a double-edged sword.</seg>
<seg id="13">Many experts warn that groups ranging from the Russian mafia to international drug cartels are looking closely at the lessons learned from the Silk Road.</seg>
<seg id="14">It took the FBI more than two years of investigative work to find Ulbricht.</seg>
<seg id="15">They don't have the resources to compete with Silicon Valley in hiring, or the tools - a long-hoped for modernization of the law governing online wiretapping is on ice in Congress thanks to Edward Snowden.</seg>

<seg id="18">Historically it was well funded, but recently especially with sequestration, it's been hard hit.</seg>

<seg id="22">If you look at the FBI - how many agents do they have in cyber?</seg>
<seg id="23">"Less than 200," he said.</seg>

<seg id="26">The policy problem is compounded by Bitcoin, which represents another set of jurisdictional tangles for Washington.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Senate Homeland Security Committee, officials tell TIME, plans on holding hearings on Bitcoin within the month.</seg>
<seg id="28">The committee sent letters to nine federal agencies in July asking for their thoughts on Bitcoins and other virtual currencies in the hopes of developing a holistic approach to the so-called cryptocurrency that neither stifles the currency's potential nor enables criminals to abuse it.</seg>
<seg id="29">"As with all emerging technologies, the federal government must make sure that potential threats and risks are dealt with swiftly," Committee Chairman Tom Carper, a Delaware Democrat, and the committee's top Republican, Tom Coburn, wrote in the letters.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, we must also ensure that rash or uninformed actions don't stifle a potentially valuable technology.</seg>
<seg id="31">Bitcoin can be a force for good.</seg>
<seg id="32">"We've grown used to the idea that virtual transactions should be tracked because they can be; whereas Bitcoin brings anonymity back into online commerce," says Sasha Meinrath, director of the New America Foundation's Open Technology Institute.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's amazing how scary this notion is to law enforcement.</seg>
<seg id="34">But I see it as akin to trade in gold, cash transactions, and barter: not something to be feared, but simply another useful tool for commerce.</seg>
<seg id="35">And yet, virtual currencies have a complex past.</seg>
<seg id="36">In recent years, Liberty Reserve and e-Gold both ran afoul of the law, mostly for money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="37">U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement seized funds from the world's largest Bitcoin exchange, Mt.</seg>
<seg id="38">Gox, in May charging that the company was operating an unlicensed money transmitting service.</seg>
<seg id="39">Mt.</seg>
<seg id="40">Gox has since moved to put names to Bitcoin transfers and register with federal and state governments.</seg>
<seg id="41">There is about $2 billion Bitcoin in existence today.</seg>
<seg id="42">Authorities say Silk Road transactions amounted to $1.2 billion in Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="43">Indeed, regulators have already taken an active interest in Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Senate Finance Committee is looking at language to regulate virtual currencies its tax code overhaul.</seg>
<seg id="45">They're also considering giving the IRS more money to track virtual tax havens, Senate sources tell TIME.</seg>
<seg id="46">A Government Accountability Office report in June warned that virtual currencies like Bitcoin could be abused as tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="47">New York Financial Services Superintendent Benjamin Lawsky sent subpoenas to 22 Bitcoin businesses this summer saying it was considering new regulatory guidance on virtual currencies.</seg>
<seg id="48">"If virtual currencies remain a virtual Wild west for narcotraffickers and other criminals," he said announcing the subpoenas, "that would not only threaten our country's national security, but also the very existence of the virtual currency industry as a legitimate business enterprise."</seg>
<seg id="49">A Commodities Futures Trading Commissioner said his agency is looking into regulating Bitcoins as a commodity.</seg>
<seg id="50">And Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network put out guidance in March saying Bitcoin brokers would have to follow wire service regulations - a potentially onerous requirement as each wire service must register state by state.</seg>
<seg id="51">MORE: Report: Hillary on 2016, "I'm Minded To Do It"</seg>
<seg id="52">All of this means that no one is quite sure how to handle bitcoin: is it a currency?</seg>
<seg id="53">A bond?</seg>
<seg id="54">A commodity?</seg>
<seg id="55">Should dealers be regulated like wire services or brokers?</seg>
<seg id="56">Should profits be taxed as capital gains?</seg>
<seg id="57">Few in Washington have even begun to consider these questions, and yet given the rapid growth of Bitcoin, the Deep Web and websites like the Silk Road they will surely be forced to soon.</seg>
<seg id="58">Internet users are increasingly looking for anonymity as their preferences and personal information are tracked and traded like pork belly futures.</seg>
<seg id="59">For many, the Deep Web represents a haven from those prying eyes.</seg>
<seg id="60">But, as in real life, when there's anonymity, there are dark alleys where people will abuse it.</seg>
<seg id="61">In the physical world, should we choose it, we can live a cash-based anonymous existence.</seg>
<seg id="62">Should we be able to do so online, even if it means anyone can buy drugs, fake IDs or illicit weapons as well?</seg>
<seg id="63">These are the questions Washington must grapple with as it looks at how to regulate cyrpotcurrencies and police the Deep Web.</seg>

<seg id="1">Autumn internationals: 'This is a defining year for us'</seg>
<seg id="2">Stuart Lancaster may have done a brilliant job in taking the drama out of England's rugby crisis following the pratfall at the last World Cup, but the red-rose coach is planning some big productions over the next three weekends of international action at Twickenham.</seg>
<seg id="3">"This is a defining year for us," he said.</seg>
<seg id="4">We can't make the mistake of waiting a game or two before getting up to speed.</seg>
<seg id="5">It's our job to be ready for the here and now.</seg>
<seg id="6">Lancaster does not often talk in such terms - very much the cool and analytical technocrat, he prefers not to create hostages to fortune in advance of Test programmes featuring opponents as dangerous as the All Blacks - but he clearly feels that if England are to mount a serious challenge at the home World Cup in 2015, this autumn series is a "momentum moment."</seg>
<seg id="7">The meeting with Australia is therefore a must-win match.</seg>
<seg id="8">The changes to the starting line-up were well flagged: Joel Tomkins, the one debutant, has been the odds-on favourite to replace the injured Manu Tuilagi at outside centre for weeks; Lee Dickson's form at scrum-half for the Premiership title challengers Northampton propelled him into Lancaster's thinking as long ago as mid-September; the Vunipola brothers, Mako and Billy, were selections of the "no-brainer" variety once the Lions loose-head prop Alex Corbisiero broke down with knee problems; and the Gloucester No 8 Ben Morgan fell victim to his club's collapsing standards up front.</seg>
<seg id="9">It did, however, come as some surprise to learn that the young Wasps lock Joe Launchbury and the high-performing Northampton second-rower Courtney Lawes would have been paired together in the engine room even if Geoff Parling, the Lions line-out specialist, had not been forced out of the Wallaby game with concussion.</seg>
<seg id="10">Neither Launchbury nor Lawes is a middle jumper or, for that matter, what might be called a genuinely "tight" forward.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the face of it, the partnership seems dangerously unbalanced.</seg>
<seg id="12">Over the coming months, the 6ft 7in, middle-jumping Bath forward Dave Attwood should emerge as the solution to the boilerhouse conundrum.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Saturday, he must make do with a place among the replacements.</seg>
<seg id="14">The development of an Attwood-Lawes combination was a priority for Lancaster's predecessor Martin Johnson before the 2011 global gathering in New Zealand - and Johnson knew more than the most about the realities of the position.</seg>
<seg id="15">Things did not work out, for one reason or another, but the project is likely to be relaunched sooner rather than later.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Dave will certainly add some ballast to the bench and, while he hasn't quite had the game time to force a place in the starting line-up [Attwood picked up a rib injury late last month], this is a big chance for him," Lancaster said.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the start of the game, Courtney will jump in the middle while Joe will scrummage behind Dan Cole at tight-head prop.</seg>
<seg id="18">Yes, you want balance in your second row, but I think it's doing Joe a disservice to suggest that he can't play a tight game.</seg>
<seg id="19">We've been impressed by his physicality, his mauling and his defensive work this season.</seg>
<seg id="20">Dave Attwood must make do with a place on the bench - for now (Getty) This is a young England side: the average age of the starting line-up is 24, with Dickson the eldest at 28.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is, dare we say it, almost Australian in its make-up.</seg>
<seg id="22">Yet while Lancaster subscribes to the view that experience is among the most crucial elements in the make-up of World Cup-winning sides, he is not in the least spooked by the shortage of miles on his team's clock.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I'm not pursuing some misguided youth policy, trying to give every 21-year-old a game for the sake of it," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">The people in this team deserve their status.</seg>
<seg id="25">It reflects the quality of the people coming through the programmes we've put in place.</seg>
<seg id="26">They will have to grow up quickly if they are to deal effectively with Wallaby backs as hot as the scrum-half Will Genia, the outside-half Quade Cooper and the jaw-dropping full-back Israel Folau, the multi-sport genius who set his union career in motion to such stunning effect during the Lions series last summer.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Special players create special plays," Lancaster acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="28">We know Genia is lethal around the edges, that there is real variety to Cooper's passing game, that Folau's aerial game is outstanding.</seg>
<seg id="29">No defensive system is infallible, especially against opponents of that quality, so what we have to do is make sure that the principles of our system are rock solid, that our attitude and intensity are right - and then make good decisions.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ancient 'kraken' liked playing with its food, arranging ichthyosaur bones into patterns</seg>
<seg id="2">On this week's episode we look at the way dinosaurs may have walked.</seg>
<seg id="3">THE tentacled scourge of the seas that struck terror into the hearts of sailors for centuries is more than just myth, new fossil finds suggest.</seg>
<seg id="4">Clues abound for the existence of an ancient giant kraken.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now, the first fossilised evidence has emerged.</seg>
<seg id="6">And, chillingly, it seems to have played with its food.</seg>
<seg id="7">First came the odd arrangements of bones.</seg>
<seg id="8">Ichthyosaurs - large dolphin-like dinosaurs - appeared to have been crushed alive and their vertebra arranged in unnatural linear patterns.</seg>
<seg id="9">How is this possible?</seg>

<seg id="12">Inset: An ichthyosaur fossil.</seg>
<seg id="13">Well, we know modern giant octopuses collect bones, shells and other interesting objects to decorate the entrances to their dens.</seg>
<seg id="14">And we know giant squid wrestle with whales from the tentacle scars on their skin.</seg>
<seg id="15">But the idea that an ancient sea monster harvested bones as a means of home decor did not take hold among the palaeontology community.</seg>
<seg id="16">Until now.</seg>
<seg id="17">RELATED: Fossil deepens ichthyosaur mystery</seg>
<seg id="18">Mark McMenamin, a palaeontologist at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts, presented his new findings to the annual meeting of the Geological Society of America last night.</seg>
<seg id="19">A return to the Berlin Ichthyosaur State Park where one of the two peculiar arrangements of the dinosaur-dolphin bones were found produced a startling find: A fragment of beak.</seg>
<seg id="20">A quick comparison with a squid beak bought on eBay proved the link in McMenamin's mind.</seg>
<seg id="21">" (This fossil) shows that indeed there were giant cephalopods in this area," he said.</seg>
<seg id="22">This fossil discovered in Nevada may be part of the beak of an ancient giant octopus or squid.</seg>
<seg id="23">Inset, a modern squid beak.</seg>
<seg id="24">Criticism of the idea is widespread.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some say the weird bone arrangements are merely "circumstantial evidence" and that the fossilised beak was too fragmented to point to any particular size of creature.</seg>
<seg id="26">Besides: Octopus gardens aren't organised in rows and whales attack squid - not the other way around.</seg>
<seg id="27">RELATED: Megashark Megalodon fossil found</seg>
<seg id="28">But McMenamin remains convinced.</seg>
<seg id="29">He argues there is virtually zero probability the bone "art" could have been randomly created by ocean currents in two separate locations and points out that the modern behaviour of cephalopods (octopus and squids) is only a pointer to what is possible.</seg>
<seg id="30">There is one catch for those who hope the old tales were true: The giant cephalopod would have been around more than 100 million years before sailors began to tell of giant squids pulling people off ships.</seg>

<seg id="2">Expat Robert Lund was jailed for 12 years for wife Evelyn's manslaughter</seg>
<seg id="3">Lund, 63, was released after serving nine years in a French jail</seg>
<seg id="4">Evelyn, 52, was discovered in a lake after a drought caused the water to fall</seg>
<seg id="5">By Ian Sparks</seg>
<seg id="6">Free man: Robert Lund in the dock in Albi, south west France.</seg>
<seg id="7">Lund, 55, originally from Darwen, Lancashire, was found guilty of killing his wife Evelyn and dumping her body in a lake</seg>
<seg id="8">A British killer who beat his millionaire wife to death and dumped her body in a lake has been released after serving nine years in prison in France.</seg>
<seg id="9">Expat Robert Lund, 63, was jailed for 12 years for the manslaughter of wife Evelyn, who vanished from their French farmhouse on December 29, 1999.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 52-year-old's decomposing body was only found two years later on the back seat of her car in a lake 15 miles from home, when a drought caused the water level to fall by 30ft.</seg>
<seg id="11">Lund, from Darwen, Lancashire, was not arrested until 2005, and was first convicted of killing her in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="12">He appealed the verdict but was jailed for a second time in 2009 by a higher court in Toulouse, south-west France.</seg>
<seg id="13">He failed in a last-ditch legal bid to clear his name in 2011, so he could claim hundreds of thousands of pounds of his ex-wife's life insurance, which was transferred to him shortly before she died.</seg>
<seg id="14">During his final appeal hearing, the court was told how the couple moved from England to the remote village of Rayssac in 1997 after Evelyn's first husband died of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="15">Lund insisted throughout the trial that she died in a tragic accident after suffering depression when her "idyllic new life" in France turned sour.</seg>
<seg id="16">He told the court: 'England had bad memories for her, so we moved to France.</seg>
<seg id="17">The farmhouse we found was just right, and we thought it would be a nice place to live.</seg>
<seg id="18">I hoped it would make her happy.</seg>
<seg id="19">When my wife and I moved to France we thought everything would be ideal.</seg>
<seg id="20">But he claimed his wife became depressed and began drinking heavily when she decided she no longer wanted to live in France.</seg>
<seg id="21">Robert Lund (pictured left) claimed his wife Evelyn (right) became depressed and began drinking heavily when she decided she no longer wanted to live in France.</seg>
<seg id="22">But prosecutor Henri Renier branded Lund "a liar and a manipulator"</seg>
<seg id="23">Once she hurled a carving knife at him, and on another occasion she tried to throw herself out of a speeding car, he claimed.</seg>
<seg id="24">He added: 'When she drank, she was extremely violent.</seg>
<seg id="25">I believe that my wife's problem was depression and she drank because of the depression and it's a spiral that's very difficult to get out of.'</seg>
<seg id="26">Evelyn Lund, pictured with her daughters Liz (left) and Trish (right) Daughter Elizabeth Camden, 42, said her mother had told her marrying Lund had been the 'worst mistake of her life'</seg>
<seg id="27">She died after driving home drunk from a friend's house plunging her car into a lake, he said.</seg>
<seg id="28">But prosecutor Henri Renier branded Lund "a liar and a manipulator."</seg>
<seg id="29">He said: 'She was a wealthy woman and he wanted her life insurance.</seg>
<seg id="30">When she came home on the night she died, they had an argument, he killed her and tried to cover it up by pretending she had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="31">Police had found traces of blood found on Mrs Lund's clothing and the back seat of her Toyota car, proving she had died as a result of violence, he told the court.</seg>
<seg id="32">Mr Renier added: 'When her body entered the water she was breathing so little that she did not inhale any water, which indicates that she had already been knocked unconscious.'</seg>
<seg id="33">During his first two trials, Mrs Lund's daughter Elizabeth Camden, 42, said her mother had told her marrying Lund had been the "worst mistake of her life."</seg>
<seg id="34">Mrs Camden said: 'He was aggressive and violent towards her mother and had once left her covered in bruises and unable to get out of bed for a week.</seg>
<seg id="35">I warned her about marrying Lund.</seg>
<seg id="36">I told her she shouldn't do that.</seg>
<seg id="37">Later she telephoned and said I had been right.</seg>
<seg id="38">Lund has told a French newspaper that he was freed on 14 September.</seg>
<seg id="39">He continues to protest his innocence, and says he hopes for another retrial.</seg>

<seg id="2">Convicted serial killer Randy Kraft.</seg>
<seg id="3">Photo: Murderpedia Source: NewsComAu</seg>
<seg id="4">JAY Roberts was the living definition of a hardcore infantryman.</seg>
<seg id="5">He served as a scout sniper in a unit of the US Marines known as "The Walking Dead."</seg>
<seg id="6">Soldiers don't come tougher.</seg>
<seg id="7">But during a creepily perfect spring afternoon in 1980, Roberts was seduced by one of America's most prolific serial killers.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Simply put, that afternoon, we - the serial killer and the young Marine sniper - were perfect for each other," he says.</seg>
<seg id="9">Roberts has recounted his afternoon with the notorious murderer Randy Kraft in a spellbinding post on Thought Catalog.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Marine had no idea who the stranger he met in 1980 really was before reading about Kraft online decades later.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kraft was, and still is, the prototypical psychopath - charming, intelligent and utterly ruthless.</seg>
<seg id="12">He softened up his victims with a combination of charisma, drugs and alcohol before mutilating and killing them.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those victims likely number in the dozens.</seg>
<seg id="14">Kraft has been convicted of 16 murders and is currently sitting on death row in California, but he's suspected of killing up to 51 more.</seg>
<seg id="15">Randy Kraft is on death row in San Quentin.</seg>
<seg id="16">Photo: AFP Source: AFP</seg>
<seg id="17">"The perverse cruelties he inflicted while his victims were still alive are beyond imagination," Roberts says.</seg>
<seg id="18">Quite a few were young Marines he picked up in bars, or hitchhiking.</seg>
<seg id="19">They ended up as strangled, mutilated corpses dumped on roadsides.</seg>
<seg id="20">Roberts describes himself as a "Randy Kraft pin-up boy" - 73 kilos and 175cm tall with light brown hair.</seg>
<seg id="21">He was a "Marine's Marine," straight, youthful and tough.</seg>
<seg id="22">That made him exactly the sort of person to whom Kraft was attracted.</seg>
<seg id="23">The serial killer approached Roberts in a carpark next to San Clemente beach during the spring of 1980.</seg>
<seg id="24">"He was engaging, intelligent and pleasant - a warm guy with a wry smile," Roberts says.</seg>
<seg id="25">We talked for several hours about everything - books, current events and travel.</seg>
<seg id="26">We were becoming fast friends ...</seg>
<seg id="27">He suggested continuing the conversation just up the hill in his motel room, where he had some 'good beers'.</seg>
<seg id="28">Normally, I wouldn't have gone to a motel room with a stranger, but I never gave it a thought.</seg>
<seg id="29">I just liked the guy so much, and he seemed so kind and together, that it never occurred to me he could be dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="30">This reserve ID card was issued to Roberts just a few months after the incident.</seg>
<seg id="31">Photo: Thought Catalog.</seg>
<seg id="32">The pair kept chatting as they entered Kraft's motel room, until the killer asked a jarring question: "What do you think of sex with guys?"</seg>
<seg id="33">"Finally, the long-delayed light bulb went off for dumb, naive me," Roberts says.</seg>
<seg id="34">At that point in his life, Roberts says, "gay men might as well have been Martians."</seg>
<seg id="35">He was not intolerant of homosexuality, just completely unfamiliar with it.</seg>
<seg id="36">At one point, he observed that lots of Marines like gay sex ...</seg>
<seg id="37">I told him that approaching them for gay sex seemed like a foolproof way to get a right proper ass-kicking," Roberts says.</seg>
<seg id="38">He responded with a line I remember more than anything else said that afternoon, and I was struck by how casual, confident and analytic he was about the thought: 'No, you just have to get them away from their friends.'</seg>
<seg id="39">Even then, the danger lights weren't flashing in the soldier's head.</seg>
<seg id="40">Kraft's statement made sense to him.</seg>
<seg id="41">It reminded Roberts of his role as a sniper, where he was trained to "separate one from the herd."</seg>
<seg id="42">Randy Kraft.</seg>
<seg id="43">Roberts was still fascinated by the stranger before him, who was so different to his unsophisticated, brawn-over-brains mates in the Marine Corps.</seg>
<seg id="44">I was enchanted.</seg>
<seg id="45">Eventually, though, we were at an impasse on the sex stuff, so I mentioned that perhaps I should go," Roberts says.</seg>
<seg id="46">I thought maybe I'd led this guy on by coming up to his room, and it wasn't fair to him for me to be sitting there being a tease.</seg>
<seg id="47">Before Roberts left, Kraft asked whether he could "at least take a picture ... to remember this wonderful afternoon."</seg>
<seg id="48">He asked the Marine to take off his shirt, "in the wide-eyed way kids do when asking for extra sauce on their sundae."</seg>
<seg id="49">"As I stood shirtless before his camera, his demeanour changed; I sensed a hint of neediness in him, a powerful worship of my young Marine self," Roberts says.</seg>
<seg id="50">And I was still there in that room.</seg>
<seg id="51">And my shirt was off.</seg>
<seg id="52">Quite comfortably off.</seg>
<seg id="53">Something clicked in Roberts' head when Kraft suggested another photo, this one with his belt loosened a bit.</seg>
<seg id="54">He finally mustered the willpower to leave.</seg>
<seg id="55">As I turned away, he looked at me with an expression I can only characterise as winsome disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="56">I felt profoundly sorry for him," Roberts says.</seg>
<seg id="57">He made me feel special in the most irresistible way.</seg>
<seg id="58">For one impossibly beautiful California afternoon, I was very much in love with him.</seg>
<seg id="59">And I've never had another man, before or since, affect me that way.</seg>
<seg id="60">Similar afternoons probably played out between Kraft and his victims, many of whom were Marines.</seg>
<seg id="61">Those men never made it out alive.</seg>

<seg id="1">Air pollution linked to low birthweight in Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">By Miriam Stix</seg>
<seg id="3">NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Women exposed to even low levels of urban air pollution during pregnancy may be at heightened risk of having a low-birthweight baby, according to a review of evidence from Europe.</seg>
<seg id="4">Based on data for more than 74,000 women in 12 European countries over a 15-year period, researchers say that if pollution levels were lowered to limits set by the World Health Organization (WHO), 22 percent of cases of low birthweight would be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="5">"This is similar to the number of cases that would be prevented by cessation of maternal smoking during pregnancy in this European population," said lead author Dr. Marie Pedersen from the Centre for Research in Environmental Epidemiology in Barcelona, Spain.</seg>
<seg id="6">Babies who weigh less than 5.5 pounds at birth are at increased risk of respiratory problems in childhood, as well as other disorders later in life.</seg>
<seg id="7">Pedersen's team looked at 14 studies of pregnant women who had a child at full term between 1994 and 2011.</seg>
<seg id="8">She told Reuters Health the researchers specifically focused on areas "where people live" - as opposed to industrial locations - and selected cities that are much smaller, with less dense traffic than the average American city.</seg>
<seg id="9">The researchers were able to obtain detailed birth records, including home addresses during pregnancy, infant birthweight and gestational age and sex, from maternal health centers in Scandinavia, Western Europe, England, Lithuania and Greece.</seg>
<seg id="10">They also developed their own intensive air-monitoring network, sending teams to residential areas in the study and measuring pollution levels over three different seasons.</seg>
<seg id="11">Pedersen and her colleagues also used data from air monitoring stations and combined it with information on traffic density and land use.</seg>
<seg id="12">When they looked at women's exposure during pregnancy to the type of fine particles in vehicle exhaust and some industrial air pollution, they found that for every increase of 5 micrograms per cubic meter of air, the risk of low birthweight at term rises by 18 percent.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition to the babies' weight at birth, the study looked at their head circumference because of its potential effect on brain development, according to Pedersen.</seg>
<seg id="14">They found reductions in the head size of babies whose mothers were exposed to average small particle concentrations of more than 15 micrograms per square meter.</seg>
<seg id="15">The researchers took into account factors like maternal smoking, age, height and weight and education, and still concluded that all air pollutants, especially fine particulates, as well as traffic density, were tied to an increased risk of low birthweight and reduced average head circumference at birth.</seg>
<seg id="16">Among the women studied, the average exposure levels to fine particulates during pregnancy ranged from less than 10 micrograms per cubic meter of air to nearly 30 micrograms.</seg>
<seg id="17">The results were published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="18">Current European Union air quality standards recommend limiting a person's average fine particulate exposure over the course of a year to no more than 25 micrograms per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="19">The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets an upper limit for a 24-hour period of 35 micrograms per cubic meter, but in 2013 EPA lowered the annual exposure limit to 12 micrograms per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="20">The WHO standard is no more than an average of 10 micrograms per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="21">If the women in the study had all been exposed to only the WHO standard for particulates, Pedersen said, 145 cases of low birthweight among 50,151 babies would have been prevented.</seg>
<seg id="22">"In setting new more stringent standards for ambient air pollution, the United States has taken a leadership role," said Tracey Woodruff, director of the Program on Reproductive Health and the Environment at the University of California, San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="23">But most cities in the United States are currently out of compliance.</seg>
<seg id="24">"While Europe has better regulations on toxic chemicals, the United States has been a leader in this area, and it could be that this study will be more evidence for the Europeans to take action," added Woodruff, who has researched the effects of pollution exposure during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="25">Pedersen said pregnant women worldwide are exposed to air pollution at similar or even higher concentrations than those found in her group's study, and the results "provide a clear message to policymakers to improve the quality of the air we all share."</seg>
<seg id="26">"We need cars and we need to heat our homes, but I think it is possible to develop cleaner cities," she said.</seg>
<seg id="27">It's a change that can happen and I really hope it will, because there are so many bad health outcomes related to air pollution.</seg>
<seg id="28">Dr. Jonathan Grigg from Queen Mary University of London, UK, said, "â€˜acceptable' levels (of air pollution) may well need to be revised downward in the light of this and other studies."</seg>
<seg id="29">Although this would involve weighing costs and benefits, "policy makers also have to take a precautionary approach when considering children's health," said Grigg, who wrote a commentary accompanying Pedersen's study and is co-chair of the Royal College of Physicians Working Party on air quality and life effects.</seg>
<seg id="30">Grigg, a London resident, told Reuters Health in an email that he would like to place cell-phone size personal monitors onto pregnant women to see what determines how much particulate pollution they're exposed to.</seg>
<seg id="31">That could suggest generic precautions, like avoiding walking right next to heavily used roads, that do not "either impact on lifestyle or make women feel guilty," he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">He also suggested that policymakers take steps to reduce urban air pollution by requiring reductions in emissions by cars, taxis and buses.</seg>
<seg id="33">Development of stop/start technology to prevent idling, and requiring fuel cell power for buses, would also help.</seg>

<seg id="1">Choose your investment apartment with care</seg>
<seg id="2">Neil Smoli, managing director of Aviate, at their offices in Sydney.</seg>
<seg id="3">Picture: James Croucher Source: TheAustralian</seg>
<seg id="4">FOR all those with self-managed super funds wanting a good place to store the cash, investment adviser Neil Smoli has two rules for investing in residential apartments.</seg>
<seg id="5">The first one is, don't buy apartments in the CBD.</seg>
<seg id="6">And the second?</seg>
<seg id="7">Don't buy more than 10km away from it.</seg>
<seg id="8">Smoli, whose company, Aviate Group, links investors with apartment projects he believes are good investments, does not recommend apartments in the CBD of any city because there is too much stock on the market, but going farther than 10km from a CBD risks a lesser return on investment.</seg>
<seg id="9">On this criteria, his No 1 choice is Brisbane, followed by Sydney, then Perth.</seg>
<seg id="10">He is less confident on Melbourne.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brisbane has the dual attraction of being the most affordable major metro in Australia, as well as providing investors with the highest yields, he says.</seg>
<seg id="12">It makes it easier in terms of affordability for investors to get in the market.</seg>
<seg id="13">"In the city you can still buy two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartments for around the $500,000 mark and in some cases less," Smoli says.</seg>
<seg id="14">As for Sydney, Smoli says the market is travelling nicely but he has issues with the price affordability, which is why he is turning from Surry Hills, with one-bedroom apartments rising from about $455,000 three years ago to about $650,000 now.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Where we're finding good value and where we think there will be short-term and medium-term growth is in the inner west, areas such as Dulwich Hill and Petersham," Smoli says.</seg>
<seg id="16">Looking west, Smoli says there are opportunities in Perth, but he is also concerned about the price of Perth apartments.</seg>
<seg id="17">The market is more volatile there than other cities because of its reliance upon resource industries, and he is uncomfortable about the highs the market is experiencing.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Historic highs scare us because (they're) not sustainable," Smoli says.</seg>
<seg id="19">You want short to medium-term wins from the investment but you need to take a long-term view.</seg>
<seg id="20">Smoli backs East Perth, West Perth, and Subiaco to be the best for investors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The investor offers his advice after considerable legwork.</seg>
<seg id="22">A development has to pass Aviate's 32-point and 108 sub-point selection criteria before he will recommend it.</seg>
<seg id="23">As well as looking at the track record of the developers, Smoli's group looks closely at what is going on in the surrounding area of a proposed development.</seg>
<seg id="24">"We look at supply and demand ratios, how much stock is there in existence, what are the current vacancy rates, what's being approved, what's under construction," he says.</seg>
<seg id="25">Aviate has assisted more than 28,000 investors since 2001, and the group has the support of institutions such as the National Australia Bank, Plan Australia and Choice Aggregation and Mortgage Choice.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Melbourne, Smoli joins a plethora of experts who are concerned about the oversupply of apartments.</seg>
<seg id="27">BIS Shrapnel managing director Paul Mellor recently told The Australian that Melbourne has had more than 20,000 building commencements a year since 2010 when the city generates underlying demand for only about 12,000.</seg>
<seg id="28">Smoliwarns investors about purchasing in Southbank, Docklands and even past "trophy suburbs" such as Richmond, South Yarra, Doncaster and Box Hill.</seg>

<seg id="2">A man dressed in a Nazi uniform with a swastika armband was asked to leave a British supermarket following complaints by customers to the manager of the shop, who called the police, according to the shop on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">"We received a number of complaints from customers, so we asked him to leave the shop," explained a spokesperson for the Asda chain of supermarkets.</seg>
<seg id="4">The shop called the police for assistance, but "by the time they arrived he had already left without making a scene," she added.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I was queuing when I saw a woman who seemed very upset.</seg>
<seg id="6">People were flabbergasted.</seg>
<seg id="7">You don't go out in public dressed like that unless you want to attract attention," said one customer, Rosina Rusin, 60, to the Cambridge News.</seg>
<seg id="8">The incident occurred on Thursday - Halloween - when it is customary to dress up as a monster, but it is hard to believe that this was a hoax.</seg>
<seg id="9">A man from Cambridge claimed responsibility for the act on his Twitter account, where he posted pictures of Adolf Hitler.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I have been wearing a black SS armband in Asda twice a week for three years," claimed Paul Dutton, explaining that he was suffering from "mental problems".</seg>

<seg id="1">Court blocks ruling on NYPD stop-and-frisk policy</seg>
<seg id="2">A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a judge's order requiring changes to the New York Police Department's stop-and-frisk program and removed the judge from the case.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin will be stayed pending the outcome of an appeal by the city.</seg>
<seg id="4">The judge had ruled in August the city violated the Constitution in the way it carried out its program of stopping and questioning people.</seg>
<seg id="5">The city appealed her findings and her remedial orders, including a decision to assign a monitor to help the police department changes its policy and training program associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="6">The appeals court heard arguments Tuesday on the requested stay.</seg>
<seg id="7">The appeals court said the judge needed to be removed from the case because she ran afoul of the code of conduct for U.S. judges by compromising the necessity for a judge to avoid the appearance of partiality in part because of a series of media interviews and public statements responding publicly to criticism of the court.</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black and Hispanic men with its stop-and-frisk program.</seg>
<seg id="9">She appointed an outside monitor to oversee major changes, including reforms in policies, training and supervision, and she ordered a pilot program to test body-worn cameras in some precincts where most stops occur.</seg>
<seg id="10">In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases are dismissed after a police stop.</seg>
<seg id="11">An oral argument on the city's appeal is scheduled for sometime after March 14, 2014.</seg>
<seg id="12">The stop-and-frisk tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stop-and-frisk has been around for decades in some form, but recorded stops increased dramatically under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg to an all-time high in 2011 of 684,330, mostly of black and Hispanic men.</seg>
<seg id="14">A lawsuit was filed in 2004 by four men, all minorities, and became a class action case.</seg>
<seg id="15">Supporters of changes to the NYPD's stop-and-frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices, will mold a more trusted and effective police force and can affect how other police departments use the policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">Opponents say the changes would lower police morale but not crime, waste money and not solve a broader problem of a police force under pressure after shrinking by thousands of officers during the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="17">The judge noted she wasn't putting an end to the stop-and-frisk practice, which is constitutional, but was reforming the way the NYPD implemented its stops.</seg>

<seg id="1">UK Supreme Court should have final say on human rights cases, not Strasbourg, says Chris Grayling</seg>
<seg id="2">Last month Theresa May, the Home Secretary, said that wants to send a "very clear message" to judges who are ignoring Parliament and allowing foreign criminals to stay in Britain.</seg>
<seg id="3">The government is introducing legislation which will mean that criminals are deported first and that their appeals are then heard abroad to end the "never-ending game of snakes and ladders" under the current immigration system.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the Conservatives are concerned that foreign criminals will remain in Britain unless European human rights laws are overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Home Secretary told the Conservative Party conference that the party's manifesto for the 2015 election will pledge to scrap the Human Rights Act.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Tories are considering replacing it with a British bill of rights as part of their renegotiations with Brussels ahead of a referendum on Europe in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="7">In 2011-12 almost 177 foreign offenders who successfully appealed against deportation used the human rights act as the basis for their claim.</seg>
<seg id="8">Their claims were equivalent to 40 per cent of all successful appeals.</seg>
<seg id="9">Under current legislation, all offenders from outside the European Union jailed for more than 12 months are referred for automatic deportation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Offenders from the European Union can be deported if they are sentenced to two year jail sentences unless they have committed drugs offences or sexual crimes, in which case they can be deported if they are jailed for one year.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, despite the arrest of tens of thousands of foreign criminals in London alone last year just 4,765 offenders were successfully deported from Britain.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mr Grayling said that the government also wants to ensure that foreign offenders serve jail sentences for their crimes.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ministers are concerned that if they are deported before serving their sentences they will escape punishment.</seg>
<seg id="14">He said: "It is not easy, particularly when people are in jail."</seg>
<seg id="15">I'm afraid I don't believe that somebody who has committed an unpleasant crime should simply be released and not have to serve a punishment.</seg>
<seg id="16">Very often these people come from countries where the prison system is overcrowded and budgets are stretched.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Metropolitan Police is so concerned by the issue that it has set up Operation Nexus to improve the police response to the problem, which has a 100-strong task force.</seg>
<seg id="18">Under the scheme, which launched in November last year, a total of 1,000 criminals including serial rapists, gang members and other serious offenders have been deported.</seg>
<seg id="19">Among those being targeted are 40 "predatory rapists" who have committed sex crimes abroad.</seg>
<seg id="20">Their criminal history only came to light after they were arrested in Britain for minor offences.</seg>
<seg id="21">Under the scheme Lincoln Farquharson, a suspected serial rapist, was deported from Britain earlier this year after files detailing five arrests for rape were presented to an immigration tribunal.</seg>
<seg id="22">The tribunal heard that Farquharson, 46, from Jamaica, was arrested five times between March 2006 and April 2011 for alleged offences including violent assault and multiple rapes.</seg>
<seg id="23">He was tried three times but on each occasion the jury failed to reach verdicts.</seg>
<seg id="24">He appealed against deportation on grounds of his right to private and family life, but the tribunal found there was strong evidence he was violent.</seg>
<seg id="25">Under the Operation Nexus for the first time people arrested in London are having their fingerprints checked against border force records.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where possible, checks are also taking place to see if a suspect has a criminal history in their homeland.</seg>

<seg id="4">A wine list is an unusual choice for bedtime reading, but 23-year-old Julia Sewell has perused Rockpool Bar and Grill's 156-page wine list every night for the past month, ensuring her knowledge of wine remains as sharp as her palate.</seg>
<seg id="5">Ms Sewell is the latest addition to the restaurant's venerable wine team led by Michael Engelmann, one of only two master sommeliers in the country, with access to an old bank vault filled with $6 million worth of highly prized drops.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ms Sewell, who topped Australia's Court of Master Sommeliers program in April, symbolises a growing breed of young female sommeliers in Sydney, cracking the last bastion of masculinity in the wine world.</seg>
<seg id="7">Cellar dweller: Julia Sewell in Rockpool Bar and Grill's wine vault.</seg>
<seg id="8">I've tasted some really exciting wines.</seg>
<seg id="9">On my second shift there was a bottle of 1985 Sassicaia [from Tuscany], the vintage that made it famous.</seg>
<seg id="10">We also opened a wine from 1937, which was incredible because it's like consuming history," she said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr Engelmann said the Rockpool team always had at least one woman.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It's always been a man's business, but when it's just men it can be intimidating," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">There are good women sommeliers today and they can be great tasters, if not better tasters, and they show sensitivity when they're talking and describing wine.</seg>
<seg id="14">Two months ago Caitlyn Rees, at 24, was appointed head sommelier at The Wine Library in Woollahra, having fine-tuned her taste buds at Love, Tilly Devine, since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="15">She formed Sydney's first Women's Wine Society in September last year, which grew from five to 35 members within a year.</seg>
<seg id="16">She relishes the presence of industry veterans such as Lara Caraturo, formerly of Pilu at Freshwater, and Gabrielle Webster, who owns Riley Street Cafe and Wine in Surry Hills.</seg>
<seg id="17">People are surprised I'm only 24, but what's different now is the information available through the internet.</seg>
<seg id="18">I have the skills, I'm learning so much," she said.</seg>
<seg id="19">Pip Whitting, a sommelier with the Merivale restaurant group, including Uccello and the Ivy, said the days of diners reacting with "gasp, shock, horror" at being assisted by a female sommelier were long gone.</seg>
<seg id="20">"They used to say 'can I speak with the sommelier - you're not the sommelier,' " she said.</seg>
<seg id="21">Now they're delighted and surprised when they do find out.</seg>
<seg id="22">But at Bar H next to The Woods in the Four Seasons Hotel, owner Rebecca Lines still encounters "small pockets" of business types who struggle to put their trust in a female sommelier.</seg>
<seg id="23">She pinned the growing number of female sommeliers and the prevalence of the job in both top and mid-tier eateries as symptomatic of the casualisation of dining.</seg>
<seg id="24">Females can now do this job and do it in a relaxed manner, rather than in a stiff restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="25">There's a lot more room for personality in the role," she said.</seg>
<seg id="26">Samantha Payne, head sommelier of China Lane, writes and maintains wine lists that reflect the restaurant's philosophy.</seg>
<seg id="27">The 27-year-old also writes for prestigious wine titles.</seg>
<seg id="28">"I'm writing an article about soil, as it's the foundations of the vines," she said.</seg>
<seg id="29">So I'm trying to go back to that deep level.</seg>
<seg id="30">Pick of the bunch</seg>
<seg id="31">Julia Sewell's top wine recommendations:</seg>
<seg id="32">2012 Fairbank Ancestrale Rosé (sparkling) $30.</seg>
<seg id="33">Bendigo.</seg>
<seg id="34">Goes with everything.</seg>
<seg id="35">Can take this from oysters to lamb to fruit salad.</seg>
<seg id="36">2010 Matosevic Malvazija Istarska Alba $25.</seg>

<seg id="1">More calls for CMC boss to resign</seg>
<seg id="2">AN independent MP has joined calls for the head of Queensland's top crime-fighting body to resign.</seg>
<seg id="3">Peter Wellington says the position of Crime and Misconduct Commission (CMC) acting chairman Dr Ken Levy is untenable after he wrote an opinion piece supporting the state's tough new anti-bikie laws.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mr Levy wrote that the laws reflected the will of the people, that bikie gangs could not be allowed to take over the state and that Queenslanders should have a say about the effectiveness of the criminal justice system.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr Wellington, a member of the Parliamentary Crime and Misconduct Committee which oversees the CMC, says there's no basis for any of Dr Levy's claims.</seg>
<seg id="6">"It appears to me that his opinion piece was about currying favour with the government," Mr Wellington told AAP.</seg>
<seg id="7">He used his position to effectively become a puppet for the government.</seg>
<seg id="8">I no longer have confidence in Dr Levy's independence heading the most powerful organisation in Queensland.</seg>
<seg id="9">I believe it's untenable for the government to extend his appointment and it should immediately call for expressions of interest for a new chair.</seg>
<seg id="10">Opposition Leader Annastacia Palaszczuk has already called for Dr Levy to quit.</seg>
<seg id="11">Corruption fighter Tony Fitzgerald and civil libertarians have also accused Mr Levy of undermining the CMC's independence.</seg>
<seg id="12">The government is due to call for expressions of interest in a new permanent CMC chair's position in about two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">When asked if he would support Dr Levy as a candidate, Premier Campbell Newman said, "of course."</seg>
<seg id="14">The government's chosen candidate must be approved by the bipartisan PCMC, but it could bypass that committee by simply extending Dr Levy's tenure as acting chairman.</seg>

<seg id="1">Drinks groups see opportunities brewing in Africa</seg>
<seg id="2">In just eight weeks Diageo, the world's largest drinks group by sales, set up and launched a beer made of cassava, a local tuber crop, in Ghana last year.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ruut Extra was Diageo's first cassava beer - the British company is more accustomed to brewing Guinness stout and distilling Johnnie Walker whisky - and the project involved securing a tax break for cassava sourcing from 7,000 local farmers.</seg>
<seg id="4">IN Food & Beverage</seg>
<seg id="5">"Is that eight weeks or eight months?" queried a sceptical analyst at Diageo's investor conference in London last month.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Under normal circumstances you'd go: "It's not possible,"" acknowledged Ekwunife Okoli, Diageo's managing director for regional markets in Africa.</seg>
<seg id="7">But we had SABMiller as our competitor . . .</seg>
<seg id="8">We had to act in an extraordinary way . . .</seg>
<seg id="9">And I assure you, absolutely, eight weeks from idea to delivery.</seg>
<seg id="10">Diageo's rapid delivery of Ruut Extra is a sign of a head-to-head scramble for market share in Africa, which western drinks companies view as the world's most exciting emerging market because of its fast-growing economies, rising purchasing power and expanding populations.</seg>
<seg id="11">Africa, in short, is the new Asia for consumer goods companies.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mark Bowman, managing director of Africa at SABMiller, the brewer whose century-old roots in southern Africa give it the biggest share of the continent's beer market, said: "In the last two years, there has been a significant increase in competition, both in marketing spend and competition for assets, such as breweries."</seg>
<seg id="13">SABMiller has doubled its capital investment in the continent from $200m a year three years ago to $400m since.</seg>
<seg id="14">About one-third of its annual $1.6bn capex spend is to be allocated to Africa, even though the continent produces only 12 per cent of earnings.</seg>
<seg id="15">Castel, with which SABMiller has a cross-shareholding, and Heineken, are the region's two other big beer players, followed by Diageo, which has splashed out more than £1bn in capex and acquisitions over the past five years.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Africa is currently one of the most highly prized regions for the global brewers," said Mr Bowman.</seg>
<seg id="17">The 48 countries of sub-Saharan Africa may be highly disparate but what excites consumer goods companies is the expected doubling of the continent's population to 2bn by 2050, accompanied by a trend towards urbanisation - people in cities are more likely to drink branded alcohol than those in the countryside.</seg>
<seg id="18">The International Monetary Fund expects eight of the 10 fastest-growing countries in the next five years to be in Africa, after a decade in which the continent supplied six of the top 10.</seg>
<seg id="19">"By 2035, Nigeria will be as big as the UK economy," said Andy Fennell, Diageo's chief operating officer for Africa.</seg>
<seg id="20">If the average Nigerian, who currently drinks 11 litres of beer a year, were by 2035 to drink as much beer as the British do now - 72 litres a year - it would be a champagne moment for the drinks companies.</seg>
<seg id="21">For the time being, however, Nigerian beer sales have failed to recover as hoped after the removal of fuel subsidies 18 months ago that has reduced disposable incomes.</seg>
<seg id="22">Amsterdam-based Heineken, which last week issued a profits warning, said quarterly sales volumes had dropped in Nigeria and cited "challenging economic conditions" in South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="23">Diageo also raised fears of weaker quarterly trading in Nigeria and Ghana last month.</seg>
<seg id="24">Phil Carroll, analyst at Shore Capital, said: "The shine has come off China but African markets have their issues too."</seg>
<seg id="25">The continent has a history of conflict and governance issues, extremes of poverty and wealth and poor infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="26">Unreliable water and electricity supply make the cost of building a brewery in Africa 30-40 per cent more expensive than one built in Europe, says SABMiller's Mr Bowman.</seg>
<seg id="27">Longer term, however, the growth statistics are too beguiling to ignore.</seg>
<seg id="28">The number of households earning more than $5,000 will increase from 85m in 2011 to 128m in 2020, according to projections from McKinsey, the management consultancy.</seg>
<seg id="29">Pernod Ricard, the spirits group that is second to Diageo in global sales, sees this rising middle class as presenting "a major growth opportunity" for spirits.</seg>
<seg id="30">In terms of relative affordability, a beer in sub-Saharan Africa costs an average of three working hours against five minutes in the US or eight minutes in eastern Europe</seg>
<seg id="31">BPI Capital Africa analysts</seg>
<seg id="32">"We want to do the same in Africa as we have done in Asia," said Pierre Pringuet, chief executive of the French company, which derives 55 per cent of its emerging markets sales from Asia.</seg>
<seg id="33">Spirits is still a tiny market, especially compared to beer, in most African countries - partly because of cultural differences but also because of cost.</seg>
<seg id="34">Most incomes stretch only to homegrown local brews, some illicit.</seg>
<seg id="35">"In terms of relative affordability, a beer in sub-Saharan Africa costs an average of three working hours against five minutes in the US or eight minutes in eastern Europe," according to analysts at BPI Capital Africa.</seg>
<seg id="36">The international drinks companies hope to change habits by bringing low income drinkers into the formal market, first through a range of cheaper packaged beers made with local raw materials.</seg>
<seg id="37">SABMiller produces a variety of opaque beers from sorghum, maize and cassava that sell for half the price of its Castle Lite beer.</seg>
<seg id="38">Its hope is that they will graduate to its more expensive beers when they can afford it.</seg>
<seg id="39">Diageo plans a similar strategy for higher-margin spirits, which account for more than three-quarters of its global sales - but just 35 per cent in Africa.</seg>
<seg id="40">The company's blueprint for Ghana includes "a more affordable range of mainstream spirits brands which we will use to begin to transform consumers from beer into spirits," said Mr Okoli.</seg>
<seg id="41">Where cassava is concerned, Diageo has learnt fast - SABMiller made the first commercial beer out of cassava in Mozambique 18 months ago.</seg>
<seg id="42">"We feel a bit put out that Diageo copied us so quickly," said Mr Bowman.</seg>
<seg id="43">With so much at stake in Africa for all the drinks companies, it is just one example of a "fierce competitive dynamic," as Mr Bowman describes it, for market share in the continent.</seg>

<seg id="1">Repainted Traffic Lights: MP Asks Brigitte Grouwels to Resign</seg>
<seg id="2">Not everyone is pleased with Minister Brigitte Grouwels' plan to give traffic light posts in Brussels a "face-lift".</seg>
<seg id="3">The Minister of Public Works and Transports in Brussels had launched a test project in the centre of Brussels on Thursday, consisting in repainting 16 traffic light posts in the yellow and blue colours of the Brussels region.</seg>
<seg id="4">The aim of this is to both "increase safety" and "enhance the identity of Brussels".</seg>
<seg id="5">The idea is to eventually repaint all the traffic lights in Brussels, at an estimated cost of one million Euros.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the blue chosen by the Minister is "too dark", according to Brussels MP Emmanuel De Bock, who talks of the "Flemishing" of the capital and is demanding the resignation of Brigitte Grouwels.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Not content with spending Brussels residents' money like water on this scheme of giving traffic light posts a face-lift with the colours of the Brussels region, Brigitte Grouwels is continuing her efforts to turn the capital Flemish," says an angry De Bock in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="8">After her mango yellow and black taxis, she has ended up repainting the posts in Brussels yellow, dark blue and black.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to the MP, there is now "no difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels.</seg>
<seg id="10">The residents of Brussels deserve better than to see their money wasted by a Christian Democratic and Flemish Minister, who is carrying out the New Flemish Alliance program herself.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is high time the Flemish Trojan Horse was stopped.</seg>
<seg id="12">Let's not forget, Brigitte Grouwels was elected by 2,245 votes, that is 0.5% of Brussels inhabitants!" De Bock concludes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Musicals, the Great Performances</seg>
<seg id="2">Classical, sophisticated, popular, in English or in French, song and dance productions are starting to take off.</seg>
<seg id="3">After Broadway and London, Paris is finally finding its voice.</seg>
<seg id="4">It's a revolution: the French musical is establishing itself as a successful genre.</seg>
<seg id="5">For a long time, the majority of attempts, from 'Notre-Dame de Paris' to 'Mozart, l'Opéra Rock', have been embroiled in ridicule.</seg>
<seg id="6">And successful acts such as 'Cabaret' or 'Les Misérables' have had an air of mystery about them.</seg>
<seg id="7">The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin at the Châtelet and Stage Entertainment at the Mogador has changed all that.</seg>
<seg id="8">Today, these two stages are churning out performances like hits.</seg>
<seg id="9">The former is reprising its excellent 'My Fair Lady' this Christmas and has announced the worldwide production of 'Un Américain à Paris' as a follow-up.</seg>
<seg id="10">At the Mogador, 'La Belle et la Bête' could well be one of the successes of the season.</seg>
<seg id="11">On other stages, musicals such as '1789: les Amants de la Bastille' and small productions such as 'Disco' or 'Life and Times' are falling in step with the success and quality recorded so far.</seg>
<seg id="12">Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book 'Histoires de comédies musicales' and speaker at the Théâtre du Châtelet, analyses the reasons for the hard-won success.</seg>
<seg id="13">How are French musicals evolving?</seg>
<seg id="14">The choice is growing.</seg>
<seg id="15">Firstly there are the "musical shows" that evolve according to the will of the producers...</seg>
<seg id="16">Some use lovely projections of images and a true story, such as '1789: les Amants de la Bastille'.</seg>
<seg id="17">Others leap backwards fifteen years, under the pretext that you can put on pretty much whatever you want when you have Matt Pokora heading the bill.</seg>
<seg id="18">Then there are the musicals with the sumptuous productions of the Châtelet, which allow us to bring the golden age of Broadway back to life and rediscover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest composer alive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stage Entertainment popularizes variety English musicals by adapting them into French.</seg>
<seg id="20">Independent French producers are trying to make a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="21">But projects under way such as 'Rent', 'Le Baiser de la Femme Araignée' or 'L'Éveil du Printemps' are having trouble finding finances.</seg>
<seg id="22">Do we have enough artists capable of singing, acting and dancing, as on Broadway?</seg>
<seg id="23">In Paris, when there are eight musicals in a season, then it's a good year.</seg>
<seg id="24">We have 200 talented artists who move from project to project.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the United States, the cradle of the musical, it is very different.</seg>
<seg id="26">Young actors are trained in these skills in numerous schools.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are numerous jobs in regional theatres, touring companies, Broadway, off Broadway etc.</seg>
<seg id="28">The breeding ground for talent is as sizable as the number of roles available.</seg>
<seg id="29">Why are provincial tours so successful?</seg>
<seg id="30">With the exception of opera, the provinces remain the poor relative of culture in France.</seg>
<seg id="31">Few theatrical productions go on tour and most of them are usually "boulevard theatre", intended for adults, not adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="32">Musicals fill that gap.</seg>
<seg id="33">These are the same young people that love reality television and the ephemeral stars it produces...</seg>
<seg id="34">Offering good-looking (often talented) young men a leading role in a musical guarantees the adoration of young girls and often their entire family.</seg>
<seg id="35">Facebook pages for these shows are skillfully managed by professionals who answer questions.</seg>
<seg id="36">The shows are eagerly expected by the time they reach a provincial Zénith (theatre).</seg>
<seg id="37">The musicals are prepared in Paris and enjoyed in the provinces.</seg>
<seg id="38">The show is designed to be staged in any major theatre in France in the same format as in Paris.</seg>

<seg id="1">Obama's Health Care Walk Back</seg>
<seg id="2">Amid a firestorm of criticism, President Obama yesterday walked back his oft-repeated, unambiguous promise that "if you like your health plan, you can keep it."</seg>
<seg id="3">With hundreds of thousands receiving cancellation notices from their providers, Republicans have slammed the president in recent days for misleading the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">Yesterday, Obama tweaked his original pledge.</seg>
<seg id="5">"For the vast majority of people who have health insurance that works, you can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.</seg>
<seg id="6">Addressing what he called the "flurry in the news" about the cancellations, Obama urged Americans receiving these notices to shop for new coverage in the marketplace.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most people are going to be able to get better, comprehensive health care plans for the same price or even cheaper than projected.</seg>
<seg id="8">"You're going to get a better deal," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">The administration has said it should come as no surprise that the 5 percent of the population who purchase insurance on their own may be forced to switch plans because their coverage doesn't meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Let me say directly to these Americans: you deserve better," Sebelius said in testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sebelius, who is overseeing implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online marketplace has gone "miserably" since October.</seg>
<seg id="12">"I am as frustrated and angry as anyone," she said.</seg>
<seg id="13">I am eager to earn your confidence back.</seg>
<seg id="14">An exasperated Sebelius uttered that phrase, caught by a hot mic, to an aide seated behind her at yesterday's House hearing following a contentious exchange with Rep. Billy Long, R-Mo., over whether she should be required to enroll in Obamacare.</seg>
<seg id="15">More than three hours into the hearing, Long repeatedly pressed Sebelius on why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act has not voluntarily forgone government-sponsored insurance to purchase a plan through HealthCare.gov, which she is now pitching to millions of Americans.</seg>

<seg id="1">Kim Kardashian gave world 'middle finger' with baby-weight loss</seg>
<seg id="2">Hey, world.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kim Kardashian just gave you the middle finger.</seg>
<seg id="4">Did you flinch?</seg>
<seg id="5">It just happened to be in the form of her rotund backside squeezed into a skimpy white swimsuit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Or so she said.</seg>
<seg id="7">The recently engaged "Keeping Up With the Kardashians" star appeared on "The Tonight Show" on Wednesday to talk a little bit about the headlines swirling around her, her fiance Kanye West and her high-profile family.</seg>
<seg id="8">More specifically, she addressed that sultry selfie that made heads spin following her 50-pound weight loss after giving birth to daughter North West in June.</seg>
<seg id="9">I was trying on a bathing suit, and I actually just sent that to my boyfriend, my fiancé, and I was like, 'Babe, can I post this up?</seg>
<seg id="10">This is my big, like, middle finger to the world on everyone that called me fat,'" Kardashian, 33, told Jay Leno.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Kardashian brand builder, whose body makes headlines whether it's big or small, was constantly bashed during her pregnancy for gaining weight.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It really hurt my soul, like it changed how I am in the public a little bit," she said.</seg>
<seg id="13">I was gaining weight because I was pregnant, and it was just really hard to read all these stories and hear all these nasty things.</seg>
<seg id="14">The reality star took a break from the spotlight after giving birth and stayed with mother Kris Jenner as she lost weight and spent quality time with her daughter.</seg>
<seg id="15">PHOTOS: Kim Kardashian's relationships and flings</seg>
<seg id="16">I kind of just wanted to adjust my life a little bit because why would I subject myself to so much negativity, especially now that I have a daughter?</seg>
<seg id="17">I just don't need that energy," she explained.</seg>
<seg id="18">I'd rather be in a happy place when I'm home.</seg>
<seg id="19">I choose to go out with family and friends when I want to but I've definitely tried to live more of a private life because of that, because they were so nasty.</seg>
<seg id="20">Why even go out that much just to put yourself in that position?</seg>
<seg id="21">OK, we can get on board with that.</seg>
<seg id="22">No one likes being called fat.</seg>
<seg id="23">As for how she lost the weight?</seg>
<seg id="24">Kardashian said it wasn't easy.</seg>
<seg id="25">"I will say it was the hardest challenge of my life and I was dedicated and I was motivated and I did the Atkins diet," she said.</seg>
<seg id="26">So I tried it, it worked for me.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the beginning, I couldn't exercise a whole lot but then I started going on hikes with different family members and my boyfriend, everyone that would go on the hike with me.</seg>
<seg id="28">And it worked.</seg>
<seg id="29">On Oct.</seg>
<seg id="30">21 -- Kardashian's 33rd birthday -- the Grammy-winning rapper and baby daddy proposed to the starlet at AT&T Park in San Francisco with an enormous 15-carat cushion-cut engagement ring and, naturally, Leno asked her about her wedding plans.</seg>
<seg id="31">"We're hoping for next summer," Kardashian said.</seg>
<seg id="32">We're a little busy.</seg>
<seg id="33">I'm enjoying just being engaged, and I think were gonna get through [his 'Yeezus'] tour and really talk about when and where.</seg>
<seg id="34">The reality star, wearing an inexplicable sheer white lace dress from Dolce & Gabbana over a black bra and panties, said they may look into a "destinational" venue like Paris or Italy (because that's where she got pregnant.)</seg>
<seg id="35">Maybe I'll pick the place and then he can plan it.</seg>
<seg id="36">We'll compromise," she said, adding that her step-dad, Olympian Bruce Jenner, would walk her down the aisle.</seg>
<seg id="37">The former sex tape star also said that she would tack on her future husband's last name to be more of a family, a tradition she staunchly didn't observe in her second marriage to basketball player Kris Humphries.</seg>
<seg id="38">"I'm definitely going to have Kim and Kardashian as my middle name," she said.</seg>
<seg id="39">My daughter has the last name West and we're a family so I want it to definitely be West.</seg>
<seg id="40">She also said that she hopes her "sweetest little girl" "grows up to be opinionated and smart like her dad."</seg>
<seg id="41">Yeah, because he wouldn't make up a word like destinational" or constantly say "doing good."</seg>
<seg id="42">Kardashian's E! reality show, which chronicles the misadventures of her extended family, is currently in its eighth season and midway through filming Season 9.</seg>
<seg id="43">But don't expect to see her baby girl or fiance to much on the show.</seg>
<seg id="44">We're really respectful.</seg>
<seg id="45">It's definitely hard because I chose to live my life on a reality show," she said.</seg>
<seg id="46">So when I'm dating someone I can't say, 'Hey, wait, if you want to date me you have to be on the show.'</seg>
<seg id="47">It just doesn't work like that.</seg>
<seg id="48">Sometimes if he's comfortable he'll be on.</seg>
<seg id="49">I'll definitely talk about my life or my dating life with him because that's my reality.</seg>
<seg id="50">But you can't have someone on if they don't want to be on all the time.</seg>
<seg id="51">Leno also questioned his ultra-calm guest (was this thing staged or what?) about her mom's recent split from her step-dad.</seg>
<seg id="52">The pair announced earlier this month that they separated after 22 years of marriage and have been living in separate homes.</seg>
<seg id="53">No word yet on whether or not they're divorcing.</seg>
<seg id="54">Kardashian said it's "for the better in the best way.</seg>
<seg id="55">They're better living in two separate homes.</seg>
<seg id="56">It works.</seg>
<seg id="57">They get along better.</seg>
<seg id="58">They're better friends now.</seg>
<seg id="59">She went on to call them the "biggest, most happiest dysfunctional family."</seg>
<seg id="60">As for her sister Khloe Kardashian, whose marriage to basketball player Lamar Odom has been plagued with drug and infidelity rumors, Kardashian simply said her younger sister is "doing good" and that the most important thing is for her to "be happy."</seg>
<seg id="61">Well, she did say she's the happiest she's ever been right now.</seg>

<seg id="1">Enrollment in Obamacare very small in first days: documents</seg>
<seg id="2">By Susan Cornwell and David Morgan</seg>
<seg id="3">WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Enrollment in health insurance plans on the troubled Obamacare website was very small in the first couple of days of operation, with just 248 Americans signing up, according to documents released on Thursday by a U.S. House of Representatives committee.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Obama administration has said it cannot provide enrollment figures from HealthCare.gov because it doesn't have the numbers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The federal website, where residents of 36 states can buy new healthcare plans under President Barack Obama's law, was launched on October 1.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We do not have any reliable data around enrollment, which is why we haven't given it to date," Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told lawmakers on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="7">But the documents, which are labeled "war room" notes and appear to be summaries of issues with the problematic website beginning on October 2, indicate a mere six enrollments had occurred by that morning - the day after the website was launched and almost immediately crashed.</seg>
<seg id="8">"High capacity on the website, direct enrollment not working," the October 2 notes said.</seg>
<seg id="9">By later that day, "approximately 100" enrollments had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="10">"As of yesterday, there were 248 enrollments," said the notes from the morning of October 3.</seg>
<seg id="11">The documents were released by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which has been demanding information from the administration about the website's problems.</seg>
<seg id="12">The committee is chaired by Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican opponent of Obamacare.</seg>
<seg id="13">The notes were from meetings at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the arm of the Health and Human Services Department that has been overseeing the website, an Issa spokeswoman said.</seg>
<seg id="14">The documents were first reported by CBS News.</seg>
<seg id="15">Health and Human Services spokeswoman Joanne Peters said the department will release Obamacare enrollment statistics on a monthly basis after coordinating information from different sources.</seg>
<seg id="16">This will including call centers, paper applications for insurance, and data from insurers and states.</seg>
<seg id="17">The first release of enrollment data will likely be mid-November, she said.</seg>
<seg id="18">"These appear to be notes, they do not include official enrollment statistics," Peters said of the documents Issa's panel released.</seg>
<seg id="19">As the secretary (Sebelius) said before Congress, we are focused on providing reliable and accurate information and we do not have that at this time ...</seg>
<seg id="20">We have always anticipated that the pace of enrollment will increase throughout the enrollment period.</seg>
<seg id="21">HealthCare.gov has been plagued with technology problems since its rollout.</seg>
<seg id="22">It was back up on Thursday after not being fully functional for much of Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both the federal exchange and the exchanges built by 14 other states and Washington D.C. were set up to let residents enroll in new plans created under the Affordable Care Act, Obama's 2010 healthcare reform law commonly known as Obamacare.</seg>
<seg id="24">The government has said it expects about 7 million people to enroll for individual insurance in 2014, many of whom are expected to receive government subsidies.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Obama administration said it has brought in experts from top technology companies including Google Inc and Oracle Corp to fix the HealthCare.gov website, as Republicans press for details about the botched October 1 launch.</seg>
<seg id="26">Health and Human Services said it had added dozens of technology experts and engineers to its round-the-clock effort to fix the technical glitches on the site that is key to the implementation of Obama's healthcare restructuring law.</seg>
<seg id="27">Giving some of the first details of who might be leading the tech fix, HHS officials identified two experts by name: Michael Dickerson, a website reliability engineer on leave from Google, and Greg Gershman, a Baltimore-based innovation director with the firm Mobomo and who previously worked for the White House and the General Services Administration.</seg>
<seg id="28">"We are doing everything we can to assist those contractors to make HealthCare.gov a highly performant, highly reliable, highly secure system," Oracle CEO Larry Ellison told shareholders at the company's annual meeting on Thursday in Redwood City, California.</seg>
<seg id="29">There was no comment from Google.</seg>
<seg id="30">The Obama administration says it is confident it will have the website running smoothly by November 30, giving people enough time to enroll in health plans to receive coverage beginning on January 1.</seg>
<seg id="31">Failure to do so would jeopardize its goal of signing up enough consumers, particularly young and healthy ones, to the new online insurance exchanges, and would provide more ammunition to Republican efforts to delay or kill the 2010 law.</seg>
<seg id="32">Issa said he had subpoenaed Sebelius for more information on the website's technical problems, including how it was tested, and enrollment data.</seg>
<seg id="33">The subpoena requires the documents to be produced by November 13.</seg>
<seg id="34">"The evidence is mounting that the website did not go through proper testing, including critical security testing, and that the administration ignored repeated warnings from contractors about ongoing problems," Issa said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="35">The administration has launched what it calls a "tech surge" to fix the website's problems, largely centered on two existing contractors who were paid to build its underlying technology - CGI Federal and Quality Software Services Inc, a unit of UnitedHealth Group.</seg>
<seg id="36">The contractors already were using technology from Oracle in building the site.</seg>
<seg id="37">Experts from Red Hat Inc are also among the repair effort, a U.S. official said on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="38">Individuals from Oracle and Red Hat have expertise in site reliability, stability and scalability, according to a blog post by Julie Bataille, spokeswoman for CMS.</seg>
<seg id="39">She said Dickerson, the expert on leave from Google, would be working for Quality Software Services Inc (QSSI), while Gershman would be working for CGI Federal, "so they are employees of those particular companies" during the work involved.</seg>
<seg id="40">Administration and company officials gave no further details on how much help was being provided.</seg>

<seg id="2">A Sydney man who shot dead a teenager in front of his family during an "outrageous" and violent home invasion has been jailed for at least 21 and a half years.</seg>
<seg id="3">The family of 17-year-old Devril Leuthwaite wept in relief in the Supreme Court on Friday as they learned one of their son's killers, Gavin Anthony Bell, would remain in jail until at least 2032.</seg>
<seg id="4">But there were bitter scenes outside court after a man acquitted of the same murder - Guy Michael Carroll - traded insults with the dead teenager's relatives.</seg>
<seg id="5">Bell, 27, 23-year-old Carroll and a third man, Gary Markham, 29, were all charged with murder related to the invasion of the Leuthwaites' Werrington home in western Sydney in August 2010.</seg>
<seg id="6">Devril Leuthwaite was shot dead while his brother, Robert Leuthwaite Junior, was shot but survived.</seg>
<seg id="7">Their father, Robert Leuthwaite Senior, was also wounded during the invasion, which the court heard was drugs-related.</seg>
<seg id="8">Bell, who shot Devril Leuthwaite with a sawn-off rifle, pleaded guilty to murder, while Markham, who waited outside the home, pleaded guilty to manslaughter.</seg>
<seg id="9">Markham was jailed for at least three years last year after agreeing to testify against Carroll, who stood trial this year but was found not guilty by a jury.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sentencing Bell to a maximum of 27 years and 10 months for murder, wounding Robert Leuthwaite Junior with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and assaulting Robert Leuthwaite Senior, Justice Peter Hall said he had murdered a young man "on the threshold of his adult life."</seg>
<seg id="11">The home invasion was "an outrageous piece of conduct arising out of a planned invasion" conducted solely for "personal gain in terms of money and drugs," the judge said.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Such criminal self-interest has no place in society and deserves a severe punishment," Justice Hall said.</seg>
<seg id="13">The judge accepted Bell did not set out with the intent to murder Devril, but shot him after he encountered "strong resistance" from the teenager.</seg>
<seg id="14">He noted Bell "used a loaded firearm against (Devril) rather than extricate himself from the situation he and his co-offender had created."</seg>
<seg id="15">Bell, who sat with his head bowed throughout the sentence, made no reaction to the sentence.</seg>
<seg id="16">Carroll, who was in court for the sentencing, shook his head and said "He can appeal."</seg>
<seg id="17">Outside court, he and Devril Leuthwaite's relatives screamed "f***ing c***" at each other.</seg>
<seg id="18">Clutching a photo of her dead son, a tearful Dawn Leuthwaite said the courts had "done their duty."</seg>
<seg id="19">"It's never going to bring my son back, but I'm happy with the courts," she said.</seg>

<seg id="2">Children play on a charred tank that belonged to M23 rebels, at Kibumba in the east of the DRC on 31 October 2013.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Friday the Congolese army was preparing a new assault on the final bastions of the M23 rebels close to Bunagana in the east of the DRC.</seg>
<seg id="4">The aim of the assault is to flush the M23 out of the hills overlooking Bunagana.</seg>
<seg id="5">Yesterday, we took Bugina hill, which overlooks Mbuzi hill.</seg>
<seg id="6">Today, Mbuzi is expected to fall as well.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then only Rumyoni hill will be left.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Chanzu hill is not strategic," the governor of North Kivu, Julien Paluku, told the AFP.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Paluku hopes to be in Bunagana on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="10">The town, which is a political stronghold and the final bastion of the rebellion, lies on the border with Uganda, around 80km north of Goma.</seg>
<seg id="11">It was recaptured by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo (FARDC) on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since then, several hundred M23 diehards have been cut off in the farmland hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, close to Bunagana and the neighbouring town of Jomba, at an altitude of almost 2,000 metres.</seg>
<seg id="13">In Jomba, a local contact who had reported fighting at close quarters throughout Thursday said that the situation had been "calm since this morning".</seg>
<seg id="14">He also said that a woman and child had been killed in fighting the previous evening and had been buried.</seg>
<seg id="15">A little girl sustained injuries from gunfire, and three other people had been wounded. One of them was seriously hit and had been evacuated by the FARDC, the witness quoted by the AFP added.</seg>
<seg id="16">Since the resumption of hostilities between the FARDC and the rebels on 25 October, the two sides have given no indication of the casualties.</seg>

<seg id="1">Exasperated Sebelius Caught on Hot Mic: "Don't Do This to Me"</seg>
<seg id="2">Don't do this to me.</seg>
<seg id="3">An exasperated Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius uttered that phrase, caught by a hot mic, to an aide seated behind her at today's House hearing following a contentious exchange with Rep. Billy Long, R-Mo., over whether she should be required to enroll in Obamacare.</seg>
<seg id="4">More than three hours into the hearing, Long repeatedly pressed Sebelius on why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act has not voluntarily forgone government-sponsored insurance to purchase a plan through HealthCare.gov, which she is now pitching to millions of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="5">Kathleen Sebelius Seizes Responsibility for Health Site "Debacle"</seg>
<seg id="6">"There are a lot of things striking about the roll out of this and about the Affordable Care Act altogether, but the thing that's most striking to me is that when we have the point person for the roll out here, and you're not going into the exchange," Long said.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Will you tell the American public that, "Yes, I will go into the exchanges next year like everyone else"?"</seg>
<seg id="8">Long pressed.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I think it's illegal for me," Sebelius shot back.</seg>
<seg id="10">If it's not illegal.</seg>
<seg id="11">If it's legal, will you go in?</seg>
<seg id="12">Long continued.</seg>
<seg id="13">"If I have affordable coverage -" Sebelius said before being cut off.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Come on in, the water's fine," Long concluded.</seg>
<seg id="15">Keep Your Coverage Under Obamacare: Fact or Fantasy?</seg>
<seg id="16">As the chairman's gavel sounded, indicating Long's time for questions had expired, Sebelius turned to an aide seated behind her and exchanged words.</seg>
<seg id="17">A hot mic picked up the phrase, "don't do this to me."</seg>
<seg id="18">She later clarified that she would "gladly join the exchange if I didn't have affordable coverage in my workplace."</seg>
<seg id="19">But while the secretary suggested it would be "illegal" for anyone with "affordable" employer-provided coverage to enroll in the online exchange, there are no such legal barriers.</seg>
<seg id="20">According to HealthCare.gov, the government's insurance exchange portal, any American who has coverage through an employer is permitted to "change to Marketplace coverage" at his or her own discretion.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If you'd like to explore Marketplace coverage options you can, but there are several important things to consider," the site says.</seg>
<seg id="22">With most job-based health insurance plans, an employer pays part of your premiums.</seg>
<seg id="23">"If you pick a Marketplace plan instead, the employer doesn't contribute to your premiums," it reads.</seg>
<seg id="24">You should consider this carefully before comparing Marketplace plans.</seg>
<seg id="25">Still, for Sebelius, who turned 65 earlier this year, it turns out it would be, indeed, "illegal" for her to enroll in the exchanges, even though she didn't know or articulate the reason earlier today.</seg>
<seg id="26">An HHS spokeswoman said Sebelius is now both in the Federal Employees Health Benefits program and Medicare Part A. The agency says federal law would make it illegal for Sebelius to enroll in any other insurance plan.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Marketplace plans cannot be sold to a Medicare enrollee, and the secretary is a Medicare enrollee," HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters told ABC News.</seg>
<seg id="28">Members of Congress and their staffs are required to enroll in insurance plans through the new exchanges where they will also receive an employer contribution (from the federal government), despite recent Republican efforts to end the subsidy.</seg>
<seg id="29">There is no enrollment requirement for executive branch officials younger than 65, much to the frustration of many congressional Republicans.</seg>

<seg id="1">For more than a year, I have been noticing the strong dissatisfaction of people I meet everywhere: the horrendous revaluation of their properties, a deluge of taxes, the costs of all sorts of permits, endless administrative fees, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2">In short, the limitless siphoning of money from our pockets.</seg>
<seg id="3">Millions of squandered dollars could be saved by introducing a tax system that is much more respectful of the taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="4">Money forcibly raised from taxpayers reduces their disposable income and contributes to their impoverishment.</seg>
<seg id="5">In Shawinigan, despite the closure of every major business, there is no embarrassment about the extravagant expenditure and the maintenance of white elephants, such as the unprofitable cultural centre, the huge subsidies for the Cité de l'Énergie, etc.</seg>
<seg id="6">These facilities are not profitable, so they should be sold to private businesses or demolished.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also distressing to note the compulsory purchase of numerous properties to make way for a major industrial complex which never arrived.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, I do make honourable mention of the transformation of the former Wabasso into a sort of industrial incubator, but at what cost to the taxpayers?</seg>
<seg id="9">It is not up to the public purse to invest in such projects, but to the private sector based on consumer demand.</seg>
<seg id="10">The townsfolk have been pleased to learn that Lac à la Pêche and Lac des Piles will continue to supply the town with potable water.</seg>
<seg id="11">Following the departure of all the industries (major consumers of water) and the big decline in the population, the use of water throughout the district has considerably reduced.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bengals DT Geno Atkins has torn ACL</seg>
<seg id="2">An MRI test on Friday confirmed that Bengals defensive tackle Geno Atkins tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee, leaving the AFC North leaders without another star player on defence.</seg>
<seg id="3">The All-Pro lineman got the leg bent under him while trying to make a tackle during the first half of a 22-20 overtime loss at Miami on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="4">The medical staff initially thought he'd torn the ligament, and the test a day later in Cincinnati confirmed it.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Bengals (6-3) didn't have many injuries during their opening push that left them in control of the AFC North, leading second-place Baltimore (3-4).</seg>
<seg id="6">They've suffered several significant injuries in the last three weeks.</seg>
<seg id="7">Top cornerback Leon Hall is out for the season with a torn Achilles tendon.</seg>
<seg id="8">Safety Taylor Mays also is gone with a dislocated shoulder.</seg>
<seg id="9">Middle linebacker Rey Maualuga got a concussion and hurt his left knee during a 49-9 win over the Jets on Sunday and was on crutches during the week, out indefinitely.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now, they've lost their top defensive lineman.</seg>
<seg id="11">Atkins led all NFL interior linemen in sacks with 12.5 last season and topped the Bengals with six so far this year.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Bengals are short-handed on the defensive line.</seg>
<seg id="13">End Robert Geathers has been on injured reserve for most of the season with an elbow injury, and reserve tackle Devon Still has missed the last two games.</seg>
<seg id="14">"We've lost - between Robert and Geno - two of the guys up front we count on for a lot," coach Marvin Lewis said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Running back Giovani Bernard had a sensational game on Thursday, picking up 79 yards on nine carries and catching four passes for 25 yards.</seg>
<seg id="16">He had a 35-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter that was one of the season's best, slipping out of a tackle in the backfield, running to the left sideline and cutting back across the field to tie the score, slipping away from defenders along the way.</seg>
<seg id="17">He was sidelined late in the fourth quarter and in overtime by bruised ribs.</seg>
<seg id="18">Lewis said on Friday it's not expected to be a long-term injury.</seg>

<seg id="1">Privy Counsellor condemns secrecy over curbs on Press</seg>
<seg id="2">By Michael Seamark and Tim Shipman</seg>
<seg id="3">Mr Herbert, writing in his local newspaper yesterday, said he hadn't been asked to attend</seg>
<seg id="4">A Privy Counsellor has protested about the use of the secretive body to approve the Royal Charter to regulate the Press.</seg>
<seg id="5">Tory MP and former minister Nick Herbert is one of around 500 members of Her Majesty's Privy Council.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, he wasn't among the four politicians who gathered this week to controversially approve curbs that end three centuries of Press freedom.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr Herbert, writing in his local newspaper yesterday, said he hadn't been asked to attend: "Did I miss a meeting this week?"</seg>
<seg id="8">Was my summons lost in the post?</seg>
<seg id="9">His article was written tongue-in-cheek but the former Home Office minister was making a serious point, ending his piece: "We said that the rubicon of statutory Press regulation shouldn't be crossed.</seg>
<seg id="10">I fear we're leaping over it by royal decree.</seg>
<seg id="11">Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg chaired the meeting on Wednesday at Buckingham Palace at which Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, Culture Secretary Maria Miller and Liberal Democrat peer Lord McNally were also present.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Council, which advises the Queen, approved the plans after newspapers lost two last-ditch legal bids to halt them.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Queen was then obliged to grant the Royal Charter, which grants politicians the right to meddle in Press regulation for the first time since the licensing of newspapers was abolished in 1695.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plans were drawn up by all the three main political parties in late night negotiations over pizza with the anti-newspaper Hacked Off pressure group.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is the first time that a Royal Charter has been imposed upon an industry without its consent - a move that has provoked criticism that the Queen has become embroiled in political controversy.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Privy Council was meant to be approving a press charter this week.</seg>
<seg id="17">Since 1689, MPs have had this idea that, since we're democratically elected, we should make the laws.</seg>
<seg id="18">But when it comes to the giant matter of press freedom, we've now forfeited our voice'</seg>
<seg id="19">Tory MP and Privy Counsellor Nick Herbert</seg>
<seg id="20">In his article for the West Sussex County Times, Mr Herbert wrote: "Did I miss a meeting this week?"</seg>
<seg id="21">It was one of those events you cannot, must not, fail to attend.</seg>
<seg id="22">One where the invitation is not an invitation at all, but a royal command.</seg>
<seg id="23">A meeting of Her Majesty's Privy Council, of which I am honoured to be a member.</seg>
<seg id="24">I've read that the Council was meant to be approving a Press charter this week.</seg>
<seg id="25">Did the Royal Mail lose my royal command?</seg>
<seg id="26">No.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Privy Council meetings to agree the charter will be attended by a few Cabinet ministers.</seg>
<seg id="28">A number so small you could fit them in a privy.</seg>
<seg id="29">The MP for Arundel and South Downs continued: "And so, in a meeting which will last just a few minutes, a meeting in which you only speak when spoken to, a meeting where everyone stands throughout, politicians will succeed in regulating the Press."</seg>
<seg id="30">Now, as well as being a member of the Privy Council, I'm also a member of the House of Commons.</seg>
<seg id="31">And since 1689, we've had this idea that, since we're democratically elected, we should make the laws.</seg>
<seg id="32">But when it comes to the giant matter of Press freedom, we've now forfeited our voice.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's true that we licensed this.</seg>
<seg id="34">Earlier this year, we voted to allow punitive damages against the Press unless they signed up to an approved regulator.</seg>
<seg id="35">Later, without a vote, we agreed that the Royal Charter could only be amended by a future vote of the Commons with a two thirds majority.</seg>
<seg id="36">But I wonder if, in a bid to prevent political interference with the Press, we may just have allowed it.</seg>
<seg id="37">I can't see that there's a huge practical difference between the voluntary charter proposed by the Press and the royal version.</seg>
<seg id="38">Either way, there will be proper redress for members of the public who are wronged by the Press.</seg>
<seg id="39">About time, too.</seg>
<seg id="40">But, there's a philosophical difference, a chasm, one which politicians in the US couldn't cross if they wanted to, because any infringement of a free Press there would be unconstitutional.</seg>
<seg id="41">Members of the Privy Council include all members of the Cabinet, past and present, the Speaker, the leaders of all major political parties, Archbishops and senior judges and other senior public figures.</seg>
<seg id="42">Stephen Dorrell, who held various Cabinet positions including health secretary in John Major's government said: "The Privy Council meets regularly."</seg>
<seg id="43">I wasn't contacted.</seg>
<seg id="44">I was not told it was anything special.</seg>
<seg id="45">A senior Government source said last night: "At least four ministers have to go but only four need to go and only four usually go."</seg>
<seg id="46">Nick Clegg, as Lord President of the Council, usually goes.</seg>
<seg id="47">On this occasion Maria Miller was the minister who had piloted the Royal Charter so it was natural for her to be there.</seg>
<seg id="48">Other ministers attend according to their availability.</seg>
<seg id="49">There are a huge number of Privy Counsellors.</seg>
<seg id="50">It wouldn't be practical for them all to go.</seg>

<seg id="1">NSA Spying: The United States "went too far," Kerry admits</seg>
<seg id="2">The United States sometimes went "too far" with its espionage activities, Secretary of State John Kerry recognised in the first admission from Washington, which is deep in controversy with Europe over the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).</seg>
<seg id="3">After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the United States and its European allies, this is the first time that an official of the American government has explicitly admitted controversial activities in the NSA's interception of communications and data in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="4">"In certain cases, I acknowledge, as does the President, that some of these activities went too far and we guarantee that this will not happen in the future," declared John Kerry at a conference in London that he was participating in from Washington via a video link on Thursday October 31.</seg>
<seg id="5">In his relayed speech, and in the presence of his British counterpart, William Hague, the head of the American diplomatic service justified at length the intelligence practices and collection of data as part of the necessary fight against terrorism and the prevention of possible attacks.</seg>
<seg id="6">Citing the attacks of 11 September 2001, the attacks in Madrid in March 2004 and those in London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the American authorities had since thwarted numerous planned attacks thanks to the interception of communications and the collection of data.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We have prevented planes being brought down, buildings being blown up and people being murdered, because we have been able to stay informed prior to these attacks," the head of the American diplomatic service argued.</seg>
<seg id="8">Furthermore, John Kerry stated in his address to the Europeans, "I assure you that no innocent person has been misled during this process."</seg>
<seg id="9">Yet America strives to collate data.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Yes, in certain cases, this went too far in an inappropriate manner," the Secretary of State again admitted, having already had to make a statement on the international scandal during a tour in Paris, London and Rome last week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Thursday evening, he asserted that President Obama had "resolved to try to clarify the matter and had initiated a re-examination of these practices to ensure that no-one felt misled".</seg>
<seg id="12">But the controversy between the Americans and Europeans continued to grow this week with new revelations in the press.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the Washington Post, the NSA has been intercepting data of hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.</seg>
<seg id="14">The newspaper, which quotes documents obtained by the former NSA consultant, Edward Snowden, stated that the programme dubbed "MUSCULAR" and conducted in conjunction with the British counterpart of the NSA, the GCHQ, enabled the two agencies to gather data from the fibre-optic cables used by Internet giants.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to one of the documents, some 181 million items were collected during the month of January alone - ranging from meta data on emails to text elements or audio and video files.</seg>
<seg id="16">These interceptions apparently took place outside the USA.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, Yahoo and Google have denied any involvement in these practices.</seg>
<seg id="18">For ten days now, a number of major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain and Italy have been revealing that the NSA had intercepted massive quantities of data and communications emanating from allies of the United States and their leaders, in particular the German Chancellor Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="19">Following the outrage of the European states, and even though leaks to the American press stated that the American President was not up-to-date with these spying activities, Barack Obama has refused to comment on the matter, citing national security.</seg>
<seg id="20">On the other hand, the head of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied that his intelligence agency had captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.</seg>
<seg id="21">He even pointed the finger back at the European intelligence services who allegedly got hold of these communications before passing them on to the NSA.</seg>
<seg id="22">This concerned "military operations" in countries where the NATO allies are cooperating with the United States and this absolutely did not target Europe, according to General Alexander.</seg>
<seg id="23">The discord spread to Asia on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Indonesia summoned the Australian ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international espionage network, which has also aroused the ire of China.</seg>

<seg id="1">Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid</seg>
<seg id="2">Former NSW Labor minister Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the state's corruption watchdog.</seg>
<seg id="3">Former NSW minister Joe Tripodi has denied changing maritime leases policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on government-controlled land.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday widened its inquiry into whether Mr Obeid lobbied several state ministers to have leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeids owned two restaurants and a cafe, renewed without going to tender after their expiration in August 2005.</seg>
<seg id="5">It's now investigating allegations Mr Tripodi knew of Mr Obeid's secret interest in the properties, after evidence given by Mr Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="6">During years of discussions starting in 2005 the government had been pushing for the leases to go to public tender.</seg>
<seg id="7">The lessees were against this and also wanted longer terms.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2009 leases for the Circular Quay enterprises, which earned the Obeids about $2.5 million annually, were renewed without going to public tender.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Tripodi, who was ports minister from February 2006 until November 2009, was initially in favour of public tenders.</seg>
<seg id="10">But he denied the changes were made at the request of Mr Obeid, who Mr Tripodi acknowledged was urging a shift in government lease policy.</seg>
<seg id="11">A phone transcript tabled in ICAC showed calls in August and September 2007 between Mr Obeid, Mr Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior bureaucrat who had come into the ports ministry after working under Mr Obeid in the fisheries department.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Was the matter being discussed in the course of these telephone conversations the development of the commercial lease policy," Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr Tripodi.</seg>
<seg id="13">"No," Mr Tripodi replied.</seg>
<seg id="14">I can't remember what was discussed but it definitely wasn't that.</seg>
<seg id="15">Definitely not between myself and Mr Obeid.</seg>

<seg id="1">Kerry: NSA surveillance went 'too far'; excessive spying will end</seg>
<seg id="2">1 (UPI) -- U.S. National Security Agency surveillance went "too far" in some cases, and those excessive activities will end, Secretary of State John Kerry said.</seg>
<seg id="3">"There is no question that the president and I and others in government have, actually, learned of some things that have been happening in many ways on an automatic pilot, because the technology is there and the ability has been there [to eavesdrop]," Kerry told a London conference organized by the international Open Government Partnership, which seeks government commitments to transparency and accountability.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I acknowledge, as has the president, some of these actions have reached too far, and we are going to make sure that that does not happen in the future," Kerry said by video link.</seg>
<seg id="5">President Barack Obama has promised a review of U.S. intelligence gathering but has not said it went too far.</seg>
<seg id="6">Kerry's remarks came as the U.S. State Department said the secretary would travel to Europe and the Middle East next week, in part to repair damage caused by reports of U.S. eavesdropping on its allies.</seg>
<seg id="7">Kerry defended the motives of U.S. intelligence gathering, insisting "innocent people are not being abused in this process" and saying U.S. and other nations' surveillance has saved lives.</seg>
<seg id="8">With the rise of radical extremism and terrorist attacks in the United States and elsewhere, "the United States and others came together -- others, I emphasize to you -- and realized that we're dealing in the new world where people are willing to blow themselves up," Kerry told the conference, whose panelists also included British Foreign Secretary William Hague.</seg>
<seg id="9">"There are countless examples of this," he said, citing several, including the September terrorist attack by the militant al-Shabaab Islamist group on a Nairobi, Kenya, shopping mall that led to at least 72 deaths, including 61 civilians.</seg>
<seg id="10">What if you were able to intercept that?</seg>
<seg id="11">Kerry said.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We have actually prevented airplanes from going down, buildings from being blown up, people from being assassinated because we've been able to learn ahead of time of the plans," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the surveillance, "in some cases," went "too far, inappropriately," Kerry repeated, and the president, our president, is determined to try to clarify and make clear for people that he's now doing a thorough review in order that nobody will have a sense of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="14">Kerry criticized news coverage about the surveillance, which he said included "an enormous amount of exaggeration and misreporting."</seg>
<seg id="15">He said it's not true 70 million people "were being listened to" in France.</seg>
<seg id="16">They weren't.</seg>
<seg id="17">It didn't happen," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">French newspaper Le Monde reported Oct.</seg>
<seg id="19">21 not that people were being listened to but that the NSA collected some 70.3 million phone records inside France from Dec.</seg>
<seg id="20">10, 2012, to Jan.</seg>
<seg id="21">The report prompted Paris to lodge a protest with Washington.</seg>
<seg id="22">NSA Director Gen. Keith Alexander told Congress Tuesday the spying was not done by the NSA but by allied European intelligence services and secretly supplied to the NSA under longstanding intelligence-sharing arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="23">A U.S. analysis of the document published by Le Monde concluded the phone records Paris collected and shared with Washington were actually from outside France, The Wall Street Journal reported.</seg>
<seg id="24">French officials declined to comment.</seg>

<seg id="6">It looked like curtains for the lucky sea lion, as the three-tonne whale came hurtling up the shoreline.</seg>
<seg id="7">But with a swift dart to its left, the pup managed to outsmart the giant orca, swimming away to safety and leaving the whale hungry.</seg>
<seg id="8">Narrow escape: This lucky seal (circled) manages to escape the terrifying killer whale attack</seg>
<seg id="9">The shots were taken in Patagonia, Argentina, by wildlife photographer Pablo Cersosimo, 44.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr Cersosimo, who returns to the same peninsula every year to shoot whales" hunting season, said that a group of wildlife photographers had named the nine-year-old whale Mica, and it just wasn't her day.</seg>
<seg id="11">Watching the most intelligent predator from the sea going full speed out of the water when they hunt is very special.</seg>
<seg id="12">It doesn't matter how many times I've seen it or photographed it, the scenario is always different -- there's a lot of adrenaline in the air.</seg>
<seg id="13">Sometimes I feel sorry about the sea lion pups because from the very first moments of their lives they face a lot of challenging situations in order to survive -- they are really tough animals.</seg>

<seg id="19">This is a spectacular natural event that only happens in this part of the world, as these orcas have developed a very difficult and dangerous hunting method.</seg>
<seg id="20">He continued, 'There's a lot of strategy in their action, and some of this orcas work together to capture the sea lions from the shoreline.</seg>
<seg id="21">When an orca captures a sea lion, they take it 50 meters offshore, release it and they start playing with it by hitting it with their tales and biting it.</seg>
<seg id="22">The pup tries to escape by reaching the beach the orcas let them arrive very close, sometimes two meters away but then they capture it again.</seg>
<seg id="23">This behavior seems to be cruel, but orcas teach the youngest how to chase and hunt and its the way it has to be in nature.</seg>
<seg id="24">But the hardy sea lion didn't seem too perturbed by its near-death experience and was soon back in the waves again.</seg>
<seg id="25">Mr Cersosimo added: 'Every year I have different chances of shooting these events, but it's not easy and many times you don't get what you want despite waiting for 10 hours, every day for two months.</seg>

<seg id="2">A "genuineness" test for foreign workers on 457 visas is being considered by the government as it contemplates expanding a crackdown.</seg>
<seg id="3">The test, if adopted, would be applied through a criteria aimed at preventing 457s being used to fill unskilled positions or as a back door way to move family and friends to Australia.</seg>
<seg id="4">A government discussion paper was released today as former Labor MP Maxine McKew slammed the government's rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia's neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Loud declarations about 'foreigners getting to the back of the queue' and 'Aussie jobs first' are a very unpleasant throwback to a time when unions demanded a protected labor market," she told the Australia India Institute today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Historically, that meant it was white labour that had to be protected - and if some in the region saw echoes of that historic artifact, I wouldn't be surprised.</seg>
<seg id="7">The discussion paper outlines 12 measures that were previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.</seg>
<seg id="8">Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was yesterday in Sri Lanka where he is meeting officials about people smuggling, has implemented five of the recommended changes with the remainder under consideration.</seg>
<seg id="9">If the "genuineness" criteria was adopted a visa applicant could be scrutinised about "whether the nomination is genuine in circumstances where the nominee is a relation or personal associate of an owner or relevant person of the sponsoring business."</seg>
<seg id="10">Businesses could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders after previously businesses who had intended to sponsor a small number of workers then employed hundreds.</seg>

<seg id="1">How Biometrics Will Invade Our Lives</seg>
<seg id="2">Is it the end of passwords to access a smartphone or pay for purchases?</seg>
<seg id="3">US, French and Japanese researchers are predicting a future where we will be recognised by biometric sensors on telephones and computers.</seg>
<seg id="4">Bernard Didier, vice-president of Morpho, believes this will be the "century of biometrics".</seg>
<seg id="5">Biometrics will be the only way of guaranteeing the identity of an individual carrying out transactions in a world as transverse and transnational as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="6">Organisations devoted to privacy protection note this fascination for biometrics, but are concerned.</seg>
<seg id="7">In France alone in 2011, the National Commission for Information Technology and Civil Liberties authorised 774 imprint recognition systems, for recognising fingerprints, the shape of the hand or networks of veins in the hand, for businesses, institutions, cafeterias, etc.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Everyone will soon be identifiable, anywhere and any time," says a concerned Justin Brookman, consumer privacy director for the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology) in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="9">But why such optimism for some and pessimism for others?</seg>
<seg id="10">Biometrics will rely on new technologies that will enable new services to be provided to citizens and consumers.</seg>
<seg id="11">In France today, the most commonly used biometric data are fingerprints, hand geometry and the network of veins in the palm or fingers.</seg>
<seg id="12">But each of these techniques has its limitations.</seg>
<seg id="13">"For example, people who work with cement have damage to their fingers that renders their fingerprints unreadable," notes Philippe Robin, technical director for identification at Thales Communications & Security.</seg>
<seg id="14">Furthermore, the detection and verification of a network of veins or of hand geometry require a voluntary and specific gesture on the part of individuals.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is both a security mechanism - this data cannot be captured without people knowing - and an inconvenience - the procedure sometimes has to be repeated and so takes time.</seg>
<seg id="16">As a consequence, research has been conducted over the past twenty years into other methods, such as face or iris recognition (the coloured part of the eye).</seg>
<seg id="17">Thanks to the improved precision of the sensors and the calculating capacity of the computers used to analyse this data, these techniques are becoming practical.</seg>
<seg id="18">The accuracy of face recognition has improved tenfold over the past five years, considers Cyrille Bataller, R&D laboratory director at Accenture in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="19">With our help, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have deployed automated passport gates that use face recognition.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Today we are carrying out research into voice and gait recognition using sonic sensors, but it requires a silent environment," says Sridhar Lyengar, director of security research at Intel Labs.</seg>
<seg id="22">DNA, a unique and unfalsifiable marker, also arouses hope and concern.</seg>
<seg id="23">"With the current state of knowledge, it could be considered the ultimate in biometric data," confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, director of research, innovation and forecasting at the CNIL.</seg>
<seg id="24">But DNA analysis still takes a long time and is expensive.</seg>
<seg id="25">NEC is offering the judicial police a portable pack costing 90,000 euros that can analyse DNA samples on a crime scene within an hour.</seg>
<seg id="26">The uses of biometrics fall into two groups: identification (recognition of one person amongst others) and authentication (confirmation that a person is who they say they are).</seg>
<seg id="27">Until now, identification has consisted of the provision of identity papers: biometric systems (fingerprints, photos, iris, etc.) will have to be given access to information that the state holds on every citizen already on file.</seg>
<seg id="28">This will provide assurance that someone is not trying to usurp the identity of another.</seg>
<seg id="29">This principle of comparison can be used for other purposes.</seg>
<seg id="30">NEC is therefore proposing VIP recognition at the entrance of a hotel or store.</seg>
<seg id="31">"We are gathering images from surveillance cameras and comparing them with photos of celebrities that are freely available on the Internet," explains Dany Nassif, business development director for biometric identification solutions at NEC France.</seg>
<seg id="32">Another use is to take a photo of someone queuing in a shop, follow his progress using face recognition and work out the waiting time.</seg>
<seg id="33">Authentication initially concerned physical (at borders, in protected locations, in a cafeteria etc.) or digital presence (logging on to a computer).</seg>
<seg id="34">Added to this, more recently, are presence checks.</seg>
<seg id="35">"A biometric timekeeper prevents the situation where one colleague clocks in on behalf of another," asserts Cyrille Bataller from Accenture.</seg>
<seg id="36">But, more and more, authentication will also involve transactions, in particular those carried out using devices connected to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from some cash machines by inserting your card and placing your hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the use of a PIN.</seg>
<seg id="38">A similar technique is being tested at Villeneuve-d'Ascq and in Angoulême by the company Natural Security, in partnership with banks and major retailers: at the point of paying with a card in a shop, the customer does not enter a code - they place a finger in a reader, which scans the veins.</seg>
<seg id="39">The experiment is expected to last six months.</seg>
<seg id="40">If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon be seen in shops in France.</seg>
<seg id="41">Ways to reassure users</seg>
<seg id="42">There are three ways to make biometrics appealing to the general public.</seg>
<seg id="43">The first is to explain how it can save time.</seg>
<seg id="44">"If a customer spends thirty seconds less at a till thanks to biometrics, it would be nice," says the manager of a major store.</seg>
<seg id="45">The second is to offer personalised services: in a few years a voice server will be able to recognise your voice and offer you customised options.</seg>
<seg id="46">Finally, the public can be reassured by highlighting the measures implemented to protect databases.</seg>
<seg id="47">"Digital fingerprints are stored in a primary server; the identities of individuals are in a second database. The correlation between the two sets of information is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which locks up if anyone tries to move it," specifies Philippe Robin from Thales.</seg>
<seg id="48">However, given the lack of in-depth studies, it is impossible to know if this line will really convince users.</seg>
<seg id="49">Privacy protection specialists continue to be concerned.</seg>
<seg id="50">"The advances in face recognition, the increase in the number of surveillance cameras and the huge number of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa make me fear the worst: widespread surveillance," predicts Andrew Patrick from the Office of the Privacy Commissioner in Canada.</seg>

<seg id="1">Love, Nina: An extract - Telegraph</seg>
<seg id="2">Dear Vic,</seg>
<seg id="3">It's fantastic here, the house, the street, London.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can hear the zoo animals waking up in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mary-Kay is funny.</seg>
<seg id="6">Nothing bothers her much - except she can't stand having too much milk in the fridge (they have skimmed).</seg>
<seg id="7">Her and Sam and Will all have the same basin haircut.</seg>
<seg id="8">Apart from that, she's quite fashionable.</seg>
<seg id="9">She swears a lot (f and c), and reminds me of mum, but not an alcy.</seg>
<seg id="10">She loves hearing about you lot, so do S & W. They remember everything I tell them and they often ask about you all by name.</seg>
<seg id="11">Yesterday MK asked, "So, is it Victoria who plays the violin?" and I spat out my tea laughing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Honestly, Vic, they're always laughing.</seg>
<seg id="13">I feel so happy here.</seg>
<seg id="14">Love, Nina</seg>
<seg id="15">PS Who's George Melly?</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm in his room.</seg>
<seg id="17">Being a nanny is great.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not like a job really, just like living in someone else's life.</seg>
<seg id="19">Today before breakfast Sam had to empty the dishwasher and Will had to feed the cat.</seg>
<seg id="20">Sam: I hate emptying the dishwasher.</seg>
<seg id="21">MK: We all do, that's why we take turns.</seg>
<seg id="22">Will: I hate the cat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sam: Anyway, Will, the cat hates you.</seg>
<seg id="24">Will: Don't talk s---, Sam.</seg>
<seg id="25">Sam: Don't say s--- in front of the new nanny.</seg>
<seg id="26">Drops cutlery on to the floor and shouts, "Trevor Brooking."</seg>
<seg id="27">Will: Don't say Trevor Brooking in front of the new nanny.</seg>
<seg id="28">Sam had porridge (made by me in a pan).</seg>
<seg id="29">Tea, no sugar.</seg>
<seg id="30">Pills.</seg>
<seg id="31">Will had grilled tomatoes with garlic (he made it himself, except for lighting the grill) and tea, three sugars.</seg>
<seg id="32">MK had hippy bread (not granary), toasted.</seg>
<seg id="33">Earl Grey, one eighth of a spoon of sugar.</seg>
<seg id="34">Lucas had Go-Cat (chicken flavour), water.</seg>
<seg id="35">We are very near the zoo, but they never go there.</seg>
<seg id="36">And nearish to Madame Tussauds but they never go there either.</seg>
<seg id="37">They never do the things you'd imagine.</seg>
<seg id="38">Apparently only people who don't live in London do all that stuff.</seg>
<seg id="39">Real Londoners just go to secret places that tourists don't know about, like Hampstead Heath.</seg>
<seg id="40">Our closest, Monopoly-wise, would be Oxford Street (green) or Euston Road (blue).</seg>
<seg id="41">But the funny thing is, how near everything is.</seg>
<seg id="42">You could walk pretty much anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="43">Distances seem further on the Underground because you go all round the houses and not just from A to B.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hope all's well with you.</seg>
<seg id="45">Of course he's the Alan Bennett.</seg>
<seg id="46">You'd know him if you saw him.</seg>
<seg id="47">He used to be in Coronation Street.</seg>
<seg id="48">He's got a small nose and Yorkshire accent.</seg>
<seg id="49">He's very nice.</seg>
<seg id="50">He says, "Don't be daft" etc.</seg>
<seg id="51">He's getting quite famous now (probably more so than Jonathan Miller actually) but he's not bothered about it.</seg>
<seg id="52">When he comes over for supper he does this tiny short doorbell ring, hardly a ring at all, he just touches the bell and it makes just the beginning of a ring.</seg>
<seg id="53">That's him.</seg>
<seg id="54">Minimum fuss.</seg>
<seg id="55">Once, late at night, when I was on my own, I thought I could hear someone creeping around in the house (burglar or worse).</seg>
<seg id="56">I got myself so scared I rang AB and asked him to come over.</seg>
<seg id="57">He came over straight away (his mac over his pyjamas) holding his brolly.</seg>
<seg id="58">He had a good look around.</seg>
<seg id="59">There was no one.</seg>
<seg id="60">I was so embarrassed I almost wished there was.</seg>
<seg id="61">I said, "I feel such an idiot."</seg>
<seg id="62">He said, "Don't be daft."</seg>
<seg id="63">Went to a party last night with Nunney, the helper from the Tomalins.</seg>
<seg id="64">In a dark house in Mornington Crescent and grim-looking people all swigging from cans.</seg>
<seg id="65">I hung around in the kitchen (the only room with a light on).</seg>
<seg id="66">A fat boy called Colin suddenly tipped a packet of Trill (birdseed) into his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="67">He finished the pack, washed it down with a can of Long Life and burped.</seg>
<seg id="68">Everyone clapped and laughed.</seg>
<seg id="69">Then the boy threw up into the sink and everyone clapped again.</seg>
<seg id="70">Told Sam and Will the birdseed story.</seg>
<seg id="71">I thought it might show them that you shouldn't perform degrading acts to get attention, even if you're fat.</seg>
<seg id="72">They thought it was excellent.</seg>
<seg id="73">Will: I'm going to do that when I grow up, it's cool.</seg>
<seg id="74">Sam: I am, but not with birdseed.</seg>
<seg id="75">Will: It has to be birdseed, that's the point.</seg>
<seg id="76">Sam: I'm going to do it with something nicer, like Quavers.</seg>
<seg id="77">Will: You already do.</seg>
<seg id="78">Will worries about nuclear war.</seg>
<seg id="79">Everyone's told him it'll never happen but, once it's mentioned, it sticks in his mind.</seg>
<seg id="80">Mary-Kay has suggested we stop talking about it altogether.</seg>
<seg id="81">Not that we ever did talk about it much anyway - but it crops up on The Young Ones.</seg>
<seg id="82">MK has Sellotaped some pages together in his encyclopedia so he can't accidentally turn to that section (War, nuclear).</seg>
<seg id="83">Sam is envious of all the attention Will's getting over the nuclear war anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="84">He says he's got an anxiety too, he can't say what it is, only that it's a lot worse than Will's.</seg>
<seg id="85">MK: How can we reassure you if you won't say what it is?</seg>
<seg id="86">Sam: It's been in the news.</seg>
<seg id="87">Will: Is it to do with West Ham?</seg>
<seg id="88">Sam: F--- off, Will.</seg>
<seg id="89">Will: Only trying to help.</seg>
<seg id="90">Hope all well at The Pines.</seg>
<seg id="91">Congratulations re patio.</seg>
<seg id="92">It sounds great.</seg>
<seg id="93">Fresh air always good.</seg>
<seg id="94">Had smoked salmon with bread and butter (and lemon and pepper) at supper followed by my veg soup.</seg>
<seg id="95">I'd done a fruit pie for pudding (blackberry and apple) using a tin of Morton's pie-filler.</seg>
<seg id="96">I admitted it was out of a tin but didn't say it was blackberry and apple.</seg>
<seg id="97">AB likes real blackberries but they make him nostalgic about blackberrying in the lanes.</seg>
<seg id="98">So, to avoid a whole lot of disappointment (and his blackberrying anecdotes), I said the pie was apple and raspberry.</seg>
<seg id="99">AB said it wasn't bad for a tinned pie-filler, but said it tasted more like blackberry.</seg>
<seg id="100">Which I thought was quite impressive (AB for detecting blackberry and the pie-filler for tasting of blackberry).</seg>
<seg id="101">I gave a couple of pages of my semi-autobiographical novel to AB.</seg>
<seg id="102">Me: Did you read my thing?</seg>
<seg id="103">AB: Yes, it was funny.</seg>
<seg id="104">MK: What's it about?</seg>
<seg id="105">AB: I'm not sure.</seg>
<seg id="106">Me: Are you being discreet?</seg>
<seg id="107">AB: No, I just can't quite describe it.</seg>
<seg id="108">Me: So you didn't read it?</seg>
<seg id="109">AB: I did.</seg>
<seg id="110">I'm not sure what it's about.</seg>
<seg id="111">A bunch of literary types doing laundry and making salad - or something.</seg>
<seg id="112">Me: I think I've given you a letter to my sister by mistake.</seg>
<seg id="113">The other day I was making mini burgers for S&W when Stephen Frears [their dad] called in (looking like a tramp).</seg>
<seg id="114">He picked up a raw burger and ate it.</seg>
<seg id="115">I was appalled but acted normal.</seg>
<seg id="116">Told MK later and she said it's a thing (eating raw beef).</seg>
<seg id="117">Funny that Sam calls Stephen "3-5-9-1-8-1-5."</seg>
<seg id="118">It's his phone number.</seg>
<seg id="119">Me: How come you call Stephen by his phone number?</seg>
<seg id="120">Sam: It's the norm.</seg>
<seg id="121">Me: It isn't the norm - you don't call me by my number.</seg>
<seg id="122">Sam: But your number is my number, you fool.</seg>
<seg id="123">They disliked the all-bran cookies by the way.</seg>
<seg id="124">But liked the flapjacks.</seg>
<seg id="125">Would like to try R Patel's biriani recipe - can you scribble in next letter?</seg>
<seg id="126">Sam and Will have had new, more extreme, basin-cuts.</seg>
<seg id="127">It's a London thing, you see it a lot.</seg>
<seg id="128">I think it means "My kid is too cute to object to this f-----up hair style."</seg>
<seg id="129">S&W had a row yesterday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="130">To annoy Will, Sam said he might switch to Manchester United.</seg>
<seg id="131">Will called Sam something mysterious in German, which he claimed was extremely offensive, but turned out to be mother-in-law (according to AB).</seg>
<seg id="132">At supper:</seg>
<seg id="133">Will: (to Sam) By the way, it was swiegermutter.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sam: What was?</seg>
<seg id="135">Will: What I called you - it's German for "motherf-----."</seg>
<seg id="136">AB: Swiegermutter?</seg>
<seg id="137">Actually, I think that's German for "mother-in-law."</seg>
<seg id="138">Will: Oh.</seg>
<seg id="139">What's the German for "motherf-----," then?</seg>
<seg id="140">MK: Probably "motherf-----."</seg>
<seg id="141">AB: (pondering) It might be mutterficken?</seg>
<seg id="142">Or perhaps arschficken, arshlock?</seg>
<seg id="143">But please can't we discuss nicer things?</seg>
<seg id="144">Pause.</seg>
<seg id="145">Me: (to assembly) What's your favourite word?</seg>
<seg id="146">Sam: Not this again.</seg>
<seg id="147">Me: What's your favourite word of the moment?</seg>
<seg id="148">Will: Not counting swiegermutter, I like "antidote."</seg>
<seg id="149">We all mutter, "Yeah."</seg>
<seg id="150">Sam: I can't decide between "oblong" and "toad."</seg>
<seg id="151">We all mutter, "Toad - yeah," "Oblong - yeah."</seg>
<seg id="152">AB: I like "Lvov."</seg>
<seg id="153">No response.</seg>
<seg id="154">That's what our evenings are like.</seg>
<seg id="155">Funny.</seg>
<seg id="156">Jez told Sam (who told Tom) that the FA Cup final was going to be a Subbuteo game, not a proper match.</seg>
<seg id="157">Sam: Why?</seg>
<seg id="158">Jez: Players" legs are too tired, but their fingers are OK.</seg>
<seg id="159">Sam: So it's the same players, but doing Subbuteo?</seg>
<seg id="160">Jez: Yeah.</seg>
<seg id="161">Sam: Will it be on telly?</seg>
<seg id="162">Jez: Yes, lots of close-ups of the fingers and action replays.</seg>
<seg id="163">Sam: How will I know which finger plays for which team?</seg>
<seg id="164">Jez: They'll wear coloured laggy bands.</seg>
<seg id="165">Alan Bennett fixing the fridge (illustration by Wesley Merritt)</seg>
<seg id="166">More bad news.</seg>
<seg id="167">Washing machine was sticking on the main wash and not moving on.</seg>
<seg id="168">AB suggested it was something to do with the water not heating up to the target temperature and therefore not moving on to the next part of the cycle.</seg>
<seg id="169">It's amazing how much AB knows about appliances (when you consider he's a writer and pretty much just writes all day).</seg>
<seg id="170">Me: You're good with appliances.</seg>
<seg id="171">AB: (proud) Well, I don't know about that.</seg>
<seg id="172">Me: You sorted out the car, the fridge, the phone, bike tyres and now the washing machine.</seg>
<seg id="173">AB: I don't think I'm particularly good.</seg>
<seg id="174">MK: But it's nice to know you've got something to fall back on.</seg>
<seg id="175">Anyway, it's fixed, a bloke came round and it was what AB said (temperature thing).</seg>
<seg id="176">Misty talked me into going shopping with her (John Lewis).</seg>
<seg id="177">Then, in spite of saying she was "extremely depressed," bought vitamins, fingernail buffing things and tons of cosmetics and make‑up and special shoelaces to match her shoes.</seg>
<seg id="178">Her basket didn't seem like the shopping of someone on the brink of suicide, it looked like the basket of someone keen to live life to the full.</seg>
<seg id="179">Told this to MK.</seg>
<seg id="180">Me: She bought tablets to make her eyes brighter, yet claims to have lost the will to live.</seg>
<seg id="181">MK: Virginia Woolf had just had her hair done.</seg>
<seg id="182">Me: When?</seg>
<seg id="183">MK: When she drowned herself.</seg>
<seg id="184">Me: God!</seg>
<seg id="185">MK: (shrugs).</seg>
<seg id="186">Me: So, making an effort doesn't mean...</seg>
<seg id="187">MK: Not necessarily.</seg>
<seg id="188">Me: Maybe it's all part of the run‑up.</seg>
<seg id="189">MK: Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="190">Will: Enid Blyton had just opened a can of ginger beer.</seg>
<seg id="191">Sam: (suddenly interested) Enid's not dead, is she?</seg>
<seg id="192">Anyway, Misty seems better now her shoelaces are the right colour and she's got tidy fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="193">But I suppose, with what I know now, that could be a cry for help.</seg>
<seg id="194">November: a horrible month.</seg>
<seg id="195">"Cloud for most, rain for many" was the poetic weather forecast.</seg>
<seg id="196">I'd have added "So both for quite a few" since it's clearly not an either/or situation.</seg>
<seg id="197">Me: I hate November.</seg>
<seg id="198">Will: Why?</seg>
<seg id="199">Me: Dark, cold and a whole winter to get through.</seg>
<seg id="200">MK: January seems worse.</seg>
<seg id="201">Will: I hate February.</seg>
<seg id="202">Sam: Oi!</seg>
<seg id="203">I was born in February.</seg>
<seg id="204">MK: February was very nice in 1972.</seg>
<seg id="205">Will: Well, for one day.</seg>
<seg id="206">Sam: The 2nd?</seg>
<seg id="207">His birthday.</seg>
<seg id="208">Will: No, the 1st.</seg>
<seg id="209">Did you know Granny and Auntie X have been to stay at 55?</seg>
<seg id="210">They came to see the comedy play Noises Off, and decided not to stay in Le Méridien Piccadilly as usual, but here.</seg>
<seg id="211">It was a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="212">The minute they arrived, they asked if I could introduce them to AB.</seg>
<seg id="213">I tried my best to put them off, not that AB would mind, just that I couldn't face the embarrassment of it.</seg>
<seg id="214">Luckily, Michael Frayn (the actual writer of Noises Off) spends half his life at 57 (unofficially Claire Tomalin's boyfriend) and I thought I could get him to say hello instead of having to ask AB.</seg>
<seg id="215">Much less embarrassing because I hardly know him (M Frayn) and he wouldn't be at all interested in them.</seg>
<seg id="216">I thought I'd be able to take them round to 57 and M Frayn could just say hello and then we'd leave (I'd be in 100 per cent control).</seg>
<seg id="217">Me: I've got a better idea.</seg>
<seg id="218">GM: What?</seg>
<seg id="219">Me: Wouldn't you like to meet Michael Frayn?</seg>
<seg id="220">Me: Well, he wrote Noises Off.</seg>
<seg id="221">GM: No, we don't want to meet him.</seg>
<seg id="222">We want to meet Alan Bennett.</seg>
<seg id="223">Auntie X: That's why we're staying here, not at the Piccadilly.</seg>
<seg id="224">GM: It's called Le Méridien now - it's terribly nice.</seg>
<seg id="225">AX: Yes, but we're not staying there because we wanted to meet Alan Bennett.</seg>
<seg id="226">I tried to convince them that it would be great to meet the playwright of the actual play they would be seeing that evening.</seg>
<seg id="227">But they had their hearts set on AB.</seg>
<seg id="228">Me: Well, OK then, I'll ask him to come over, but he might be in a foul mood.</seg>
<seg id="229">GM: Is he moody?</seg>
<seg id="230">AX: (looking anxious).</seg>
<seg id="231">Me: He can be very prickly if disturbed.</seg>
<seg id="232">GM: Oh, he seems so reasonable when you see him on the box.</seg>
<seg id="233">I rang him from upstairs.</seg>
<seg id="234">Me: Would you mind coming over to say hi to my granny?</seg>
<seg id="235">AB: Well, I'll say hello (pedantic) - when?</seg>
<seg id="236">Me: Let's get it over and done with, but don't be too nice.</seg>
<seg id="237">And don't hang around too long.</seg>
<seg id="238">AB: I'll do my best.</seg>
<seg id="239">Soon, AB arrived in his coat and was very nice to them (too nice).</seg>
<seg id="240">They fawned round him like the two old ladies do with Basil Fawlty.</seg>
<seg id="241">GM quoted some of the Cambridge Footlights stuff to him and he encouraged her by laughing and then remembered he'd sent her a "Get well" and she was charmed that he'd remembered and told him about it (being ill and recovering) and then she spoke about seeing the great Joss Ackland in Lloyd George Knew My Father and Fenella Fielding in Hobson's Choice at the Haymarket Leicester and how that theatre really has some marvellous shows etc.</seg>
<seg id="242">After AB had gone.</seg>
<seg id="243">GM: Well, he was charming.</seg>
<seg id="244">AX: Not at all difficult.</seg>
<seg id="245">Me: You got him on a good day.</seg>
<seg id="246">GM: He was lovely.</seg>
<seg id="247">AX: What a lovely, lovely man.</seg>
<seg id="248">GM: Would you be able to get hold of the other chap?</seg>
<seg id="249">Me: Michael Frayn?</seg>
<seg id="250">GM: Who? - Oh no, Jonathan Miller.</seg>
<seg id="251">Me: No, he's moved away.</seg>
<seg id="252">GM: Has he?</seg>
<seg id="253">Where to?</seg>
<seg id="254">Me: Derby.</seg>
<seg id="255">GM: Jonathan Miller's moved to Derby?</seg>
<seg id="256">Me: Yes, he wants peace and quiet.</seg>
<seg id="257">AX: In Derby?</seg>
<seg id="258">Me: The Peaks.</seg>
<seg id="259">GM: What a shame, we'd have loved to meet him.</seg>
<seg id="260">Went to the Lyric Theatre to see some plays by Samuel Beckett.</seg>
<seg id="261">It was a cheap showing, one up from a dress rehearsal, but tutor Vicki was thrilled to have got us all tickets to see Billie Whitelaw (Beckett's preferred actress) in the roles.</seg>
<seg id="262">I have to admit I wasn't enjoying the show much (people talking nonsense in dustbins and making funny noises) and then, in the second half, I heard muttering from the (mostly empty) seats behind.</seg>
<seg id="263">I glanced round and saw, all alone, Samuel Beckett (the person).</seg>
<seg id="264">It was like seeing a unicorn or a Borrower.</seg>
<seg id="265">It took my breath away.</seg>
<seg id="266">I didn't look again and I didn't elbow Stella who was next to me because she'd fallen asleep and I knew she'd jolt awake noisily and show us all up.</seg>
<seg id="267">I wondered what made one person's nonsense "genius" and another's "crap..." and I wondered if it's genius if you're tall, enigmatic, reclusive, handsome... and it's crap if you're normal or short, chatty and ugly.</seg>
<seg id="268">I was just mulling it over when something AB said sprang to mind.</seg>
<seg id="269">AB is an admirer of Les Dawson.</seg>
<seg id="270">AB says that only an extremely accomplished pianist could pretend to play as badly as Les Dawson (pretends to do).</seg>
<seg id="271">Maybe it's the same with S Beckett.</seg>
<seg id="272">He could write a really good (sensible) play that everyone would get, but he doesn't.</seg>
<seg id="273">Like Les Dawson, he's pretending to be crap.</seg>
<seg id="274">Which you can only do if you're a genius.</seg>
<seg id="275">Anyway, no one else noticed Samuel Beckett there and I had a job persuading them afterwards that I had actually seen him.</seg>
<seg id="276">Stella: (disbelieving) Like you saw Jackie O at Holloway Odeon?</seg>
<seg id="277">Me: No, it really was Samuel Beckett.</seg>
<seg id="278">Then we went to a pub by the river and we all crowded round the Quiz-Master and had to keep going to the bar for more 20ps.</seg>
<seg id="279">I thought to myself that the Quiz-Master seemed more popular than the plays and that was the modern world.</seg>
<seg id="280">No one wants to be puzzled in a theatre by questions that don't have answers, they want to be puzzled in the pub by questions from a machine that do have answers.</seg>

<seg id="2">1 November 2013 Last updated at 12:54</seg>
<seg id="3">Police were attacked by masked youths throwing bricks and bottles in Kilkeel, County Down, on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="4">Shortly before 21:00 GMT a crowd of masked youths blocked the Scrogg Road with a burning barricade and attacked police with bricks and bottles.</seg>
<seg id="5">About an hour later, a similar crowd blocked Newry Street with burning bins and attacked the police station with fireworks and paint bombs.</seg>
<seg id="6">Police said calm was restored at about 23:00 GMT after a "robust operation."</seg>
<seg id="7">Officers remained in the area throughout the night.</seg>
<seg id="8">Firefighters were also attacked with stones in the Scrogg Road incident.</seg>
<seg id="9">A side window in a fire engine was broken, but no personnel were injured in the attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sinn Féin councillor Sean Doran condemned the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="11">"What happened in Kilkeel on Thursday night was an orchestrated campaign by a group of people intent on causing trouble in the area," he said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The behaviour that took place last night isn't welcome in the Kilkeel area and indeed I have been contacted by a number of concerned parents today who are angry that their young children were put at risk by these people.</seg>
<seg id="13">One parent even described to me how a rocket narrowly missed striking his four-year-old daughter in the face.</seg>

<seg id="2">Biochemist Shane Charter is set to break his silence on Essendon's alleged peptides regimen.</seg>
<seg id="3">Picture: Chris Scott Source: Herald Sun</seg>
<seg id="4">SHANE Charter, the biochemist embroiled in the drugs-in-sport scandal, will detail Essendon's alleged peptides regimen to the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority.</seg>
<seg id="5">His former associate, controversial sport scientist Stephen Dank, seems certain to be summoned to a Senate inquiry into sports science, scheduled to start in June.</seg>
<seg id="6">Dank, who is at the centre of the Essendon and Cronulla anti-doping investigations, could be one of several people compelled to talk to the Senate inquiry about accreditation, code of conduct, substance use, sourcing of supplements and athlete welfare.</seg>
<seg id="7">Failure to appear could result in contempt charges and carry a six-month jail term.</seg>
<seg id="8">Charter - who says he sourced an array of materials on request for Dank - is already co-operating with the joint AFL and ASADA probe into the crisis, and spoke with ASADA in recent weeks.</seg>
<seg id="9">Charter told the Herald Sun last night he expected to supply detailed information to investigators about exactly which peptides had been supplied to Essendon.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I will be going to see ASADA next week," he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Bombers saga took a twist last night when Dank said he had approval from the World Anti-Doping Agency to use the anti-obesity drug, AOD-9604, which is banned.</seg>
<seg id="12">Dank said he would produce the email in court, but WADA denied any such correspondence would exist.</seg>
<seg id="13">Dank has claimed everything he administered was within sports doping rules.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Bombers, meanwhile, said they had not conceded their players were administered any banned drug.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Senate inquiry, which has been initiated by Greens senator Richard Di Natale, will have its terms of reference put to the Senate during Budget week, May 14-16.</seg>
<seg id="16">If agreed to, the inquiry will go ahead in June.</seg>
<seg id="17">A Senate committee will list witnesses it wants to hear from - a list almost certain to include Dank.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It's not about him as an individual," Senator Di Natale said.</seg>
<seg id="19">Our intent will be, 'What do we need to put in place to make sure the health of athletes is protected?'.</seg>
<seg id="20">Asked if witnesses were required to attend, Senator Di Natale replied: "The Senate has the capacity to compel witnesses to appear."</seg>
<seg id="21">Senator Di Natale said tighter checks and balances were needed for accrediting sports scientists.</seg>
<seg id="22">"The issue for us, when someone calls themselves a sports scientist, how do we know they've got the skills and experience they need, and what's the accreditation process?" he said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Senator Di Natale said that in the UK, the accreditation conditions for sports scientists demanded clear parameters about background, which included "500 hours of supervised experience."</seg>
<seg id="24">"It needs to develop a real thorough accreditation process," he said.</seg>
<seg id="25">The inquiry will also cover health concerns for all professional athletes, as well as regular country and metropolitan sportspeople.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clarke reprimanded for ill-discipline</seg>
<seg id="2">It was an unhappy day three for Australian captain Michael Clarke at Blacktown, clean bowled by Tasmanian quick Ben Hilfenhaus and then slapped on the wrist by Cricket Australia for showing dissent towards an umpire.</seg>
<seg id="3">Despite Clarke's cheap dismissal, NSW were in the box seat for a season-opening win, with Tasmania 1-15 and trailing by 276 runs at stumps heading into the final day of their Sheffield Shield clash.</seg>
<seg id="4">Clarke's code of behaviour breach occurred the previous day, but CA announced after play on Friday that despite there being a report, his clean record meant he escaped with a reprimand and a hearing wasn't required.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 32-year-old was reported by the umpires for making the "T sign" with his hands when fielding at slip, to ironically indicate the men in white should go to the video for a decision they made to give a Tasmanian not out despite a low catch being claimed at gully.</seg>
<seg id="6">There's no television cameras let alone third umpires at Shield matches and as part of the code of behaviour, any player who uses the T sign, in jest or otherwise, will be automatically reported as it shows dissent to the umpire's decision.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clarke admitted guilt and accepted Match Referee Daryl Harper's proposed penalty of a reprimand.</seg>
<seg id="8">Ill-discipline is an unusual occurrence for the Australian skipper, as was the sight of his off-stump being dislodged when he was on 7.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some might say claiming the skipper's wicket isn't the smartest career move, but for right-arm quick Hilfenhaus the prized scalp of Clarke for just 7 can only boost his hopes of a Test recall.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hilfenhaus finished with figures of 2-42 off 14 overs, with his delivery to dismiss Clarke a beauty, nipping back nicely to take off.</seg>
<seg id="11">The 31-year-old had a brilliant run two summers ago against India under mentor Craig McDermott, but struggled a little last year and hasn't played a Test since December.</seg>
<seg id="12">With McDermott, now returned to his post as Test bowling coach, watching from the stands, Hilfenhaus got his season off to a handy start.</seg>
<seg id="13">If the opportunity pops up I'm more than happy to take it.</seg>
<seg id="14">"I'm just concentrating on playing well for Tassie at the moment and finding some rhythm and hopefully take a few wickets along the way," said Hilfenhaus, who said he's gradually bowling up his loads to be able to reach the 150km speeds he achieved two summers ago.</seg>
<seg id="15">McDermott said Hilfenhaus was certainly in the running for the Ashes.</seg>
<seg id="16">He's quite capable, he's not too old.</seg>
<seg id="17">"He's strong, he's fit and a couple of little tinkers here and there and hopefully he can come back," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Tasmania were set a challenging target of 295 to win, and their task got even tougher when another Test hopeful Josh Hazlewood claimed the key wicket of Ed Cowan, the type of batsman capable of sticking around in tough conditions.</seg>
<seg id="19">Ben Dunk (12 not out) and Alex Doolan (0no) face a big task on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="20">NSW were bowled out for 245 from 72 overs in their second innings, with Australian middle-order batsman Steve Smith starring with 63 and Scott Henry chipping in with 65.</seg>
<seg id="21">I think we're in a good position.</seg>
<seg id="22">"It was nice to get Eddie out ... it's going to be tough work for them if we bowl well tomorrow," Smith said.</seg>

<seg id="1">John Kerry admits US spying has 'reached too far'</seg>
<seg id="2">Mr Kerry is due to embark on a tour of Europe and the Middle East aimed at repairing the damage caused by reports that the US eavesdropped on on its allies, including monitoring the cell phone of Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="3">His comments came as China demanded the United States provide an explanation over its spying programme amid reports that Washington's missions in Beijing, Shanghai and elsewhere in the country were involved.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper, amplifying an earlier report by the German magazine Der Spiegel, said that a top-secret map leaked by fugitive intelligence analyst Edward Snowden showed 90 US surveillance facilities at embassies and consulates.</seg>
<seg id="5">The facilities in East Asia were focused on China, with centres in the US embassy in Beijing and US consulates in the commercial hub Shanghai and Chengdu, the capital of the southwestern province of Sichuan, it said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Hua Chunying, spokeswoman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that Beijing had "severe concerns" about the reports.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We require the US to make a clarification and give an explanation," she told reporters at a regular briefing.</seg>
<seg id="8">We require friendly diplomatic missions and personnel in China to strictly abide by international treaties... and do not engage in any activity that... may jeopardise China's security and interests.</seg>
<seg id="9">Australian embassies were being secretly used to intercept phone calls and data across Asia as part of the US-led global spying network, the Sydney Morning Herald said.</seg>
<seg id="10">The US-led spying network has drawn fire from other Asian countries as the row spreads.</seg>
<seg id="11">Indonesia on Friday summoned the Australian ambassador over what it called the "totally unacceptable" activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">Jakarta has also protested strongly to the United States over reports Washington had been monitoring phone calls and communication networks from its embassy in the Indonesian capital.</seg>

<seg id="1">European Markets, Except London, Fall in Mid-session</seg>
<seg id="2">The major European stock markets, except London, are on a down trend in mid-session this Friday. They are being dragged down by disappointing news from businesses, while Wall Street is expected to experience a rise.</seg>
<seg id="3">Also, investors are still treading with caution, as they believe that the American Federal Reserve might end its quantitative easing policy earlier than expected.</seg>
<seg id="4">On the other hand, following the announcement of a 0.7% inflation throughout the eurozone, the idea that the European Central Bank (ECB) might relax its monetary policy has been spreading amongst actors in the market .</seg>
<seg id="5">Futures on Wall Street are suggesting that opening price of US shares will rise, following two consecutive sessions marked by a downward trend.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the securities market, Renault (-4.63%) recorded the greatest drop with the CAC 40, weighed down by the profit warning issued by its partner, Nissan Motor, on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) recorded the worst performance in the EuroFirst300, after also reporting a decline in earnings this morning and announcing the creation of an internal bad bank structure covering £38 000 million of its highest risk assets.</seg>
<seg id="8">On its part, Vodafone (+2.45%) is still leading the upward trend in the EuroFirst300 in response to a press release indicating that AT&T was looking at a possible takeover bid.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the exchange market, speculation regarding a change in the ECB's monetary policy are rife, as testified by John Hardy, a strategist at Saxo Bank.</seg>
<seg id="10">The ECB's sole mandate has always revolved around inflation, therefore Mario Draghi and his team have all the more reason to take action at their meeting next week.</seg>
<seg id="11">We are forecasting a highly likely drop in the Euro.</seg>
<seg id="12">In this context, the Euro continues to drop as compared to the US dollar and, during the session, reached a record two-week low at $1.3517.</seg>
<seg id="13">Conversely, these very speculations are boosting the bond market in the eurozone.</seg>

<seg id="15">It is such a difficult question to explain to him.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is the most heartbreaking thing," he said.</seg>

<seg id="20">"We are still working on it so we cannot offer any comment or make any assumption on the motives," the Fenxi officer said.</seg>
<seg id="21">Police offered a 100,000 yuan ($17,918) reward for information leading to the arrest of the sole suspect, who they said was a woman.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pope Francis to name first cardinals in February</seg>
<seg id="2">Pope Francis will create new cardinals of the Catholic Church for his first time on February 22, the Vatican announced Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Cardinals are the highest-ranking clergy in the Catholic Church below the pope, and they're the ones who elect popes, so Francis will be appointing his first group of men who will ultimately help choose his successor.</seg>
<seg id="4">There are now 201 cardinals.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, once a cardinal reaches 80 he is no longer permitted to participate in the election of a pope -- this falls to a group of 120 "cardinal electors."</seg>
<seg id="6">In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said a meeting of all the existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony to elevate the new cardinals, known as a consistory.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convoke February's consistory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings involving the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal electors was likely to have dropped.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said usually a pope would name as many cardinals as was needed to raise the number of cardinal electors back to 120 and as many cardinals aged over 80 as he wanted.</seg>
<seg id="10">Next year's consistory would be significant because it would be the first since Francis was elected in March this year, Valero said.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the moment there is a sort of bias towards Europe and especially towards Italy.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will nominate cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have a tiny number of cardinals.</seg>
<seg id="14">The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with looking into ways to reform the church.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the past the Pope decided everything on his own.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Now Francis has selected these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said it was "quite possible" that Francis would ask the cardinals for advice.</seg>
<seg id="18">But we've not been in that situation before -- it's all completely new.</seg>
<seg id="19">Valero said popes typically elevated bishops from large places to the position of cardinal but that Francis was "full of surprises -- so we don't know who he'll name."</seg>

<seg id="1">China Says Terror Group Behind Tiananmen Attack</seg>
<seg id="2">China's domestic security chief said a terrorist organization was behind this week's attack at Beijing's Tiananmen gate that left five people dead and 40 injured.</seg>
<seg id="3">Speaking at a meeting in Uzbekistan, the official, Meng Jianzhu, said the East Turkestan Islamic Movement was a "behind-the-scenes instigator" of the assault Monday.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The terrorist incident in Beijing was an organized, premeditated activity," he told Phoenix Television, a Hong Kong-based broadcaster.</seg>
<seg id="5">The behind-the-scenes instigator is the East Turkestan Islamic Movement that is entrenched in central and west Asia.</seg>
<seg id="6">Mr. Meng, who was participating in a meeting of the antiterrorism body of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a grouping of China, Russia and four central Asian states, offered no further details on how investigators made that link.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Beijing police said they found a banner printed with "religious extremist messages" on the vehicle that crashed into a stone bridge and was ignited by the three occupants who died in the fire.</seg>
<seg id="8">The three people in the vehicle were all believed to be ethnic Uighurs, as were five suspects who were arrested hours after the incident.</seg>
<seg id="9">Uighurs are a predominantly Muslim ethnic group, and some have resisted China's authority over the Xinjiang region they call home and have protested outside influence on their language, culture and religion.</seg>
<seg id="10">Such opposition has at times turned violent, and Chinese security officials have often pointed to the involvement of terrorist organizations, particularly the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, or E.T.I.M.</seg>
<seg id="11">The group, which seeks an independent Uighur state, was labeled a terrorist organization by the United States in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="12">That move was criticized by some scholars who said there was little evidence the group existed and suggested the move was intended to ease Chinese opposition to plans by the United States to invade Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="13">Chinese officials have since linked E.T.I.M. to a 2008 attack on the border police in the Xinjiang city of Kashgar.</seg>
<seg id="14">The group claimed responsibility for a series of 2011 attacks in Xinjiang, and last year, China named six people suspected of being E.T.I.M. members and said they were operating in Asia.</seg>
<seg id="15">A C.I.A. drone strike last year in Pakistan killed Emeti Yakuf, who had been identified as a senior leader of the group.</seg>
<seg id="16">Overseas Uighur rights groups have questioned the Chinese government's assertions about Uighur terrorism and the Tiananmen attack, saying they are impossible to verify given the authorities" restrictions on independent reporting.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The Chinese government will not hesitate to concoct a version of the incident in Beijing, so as to further impose repressive measures," Rebiya Kadeer, a Uighur exile in the United States, said in a statement sent to reporters.</seg>
<seg id="18">Many Uighur advocates fear an aggressive security response will lead to further stigmatization of a group that already faces significant bias in Chinese society.</seg>

<seg id="2">Cogeco Cable subscribers may soon have access to applications like Facebook, Twitter and, ultimately, the Netflix video-on-demand service through their television in a seemingly not too distant future.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Cogeco subsidiary indicated on Thursday that it is currently carrying out preliminary tests of the beta version of this platform with some of its users.</seg>

<seg id="8">The telecommunications giant Rogers has already indicated that it might offer Netflix if certain technical details (which it did not cite) could be sorted out.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the United States, the popular video service is said to be discussing the possibility of making its service available via their broadcasting platforms with some major cable companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">The CEO of Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government during his speech from the Throne on October 16.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite television providers to offer customers the option of accessing the services on a pay-per-view basis.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We have been saying for about two and a half years that the idea of forcing consumers to purchase major packages of channels doesn't work," stated Audet.</seg>
<seg id="13">Nevertheless, he hopes that the consultations carried out by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) will give rise to interesting recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="14">"These discussions need to produce a new type of reference framework for the definition of the new cultural policy in Canada relating to television," said Cogeco's CEO.</seg>
<seg id="15">The CRTC has been conducting consultations with the public since last week, and these will be continued with the industry next spring.</seg>
<seg id="16">In terms of results, Cogeco has said it has recorded a net profit of CAD 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, representing 82¢ per share.</seg>
<seg id="17">This is a drop compared to the net profit of CAD 44.9 million, or 83¢ per share, recorded in the same period last year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Montreal-based company says this drop is due to depreciation expenses relating to recent acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="19">In 2012 Cogeco bought US-based cable distributor, Atlantic Broadband, for CAD 1,360 million.</seg>
<seg id="20">This was the company's first major acquisition after its failed aquisition attempt in Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Montreal company also bought Peer 1 Network Enterprises, an Internet services provider based in Vancouver, for CAD 526 million last December.</seg>
<seg id="22">In terms of revenue, Cogeco saw growth of 41.5% in the fourth quarter, reaching CAD 504.7 million.</seg>
<seg id="23">Its revenue stands at CAD 1,800 million for the current financial year.</seg>
<seg id="24">The net profit of its principal subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was CAD 43.9 million, or 90¢ per share, down from CAD 45.7 million, or 93¢ per share, for the same period last year.</seg>
<seg id="25">Nevertheless, Cogeco Cable saw a 45% growth, reaching CAD 470.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company lost 15,237 customers during the fourth quarter.</seg>
<seg id="27">Even so, the number of Cogeco Cable customers rose by 5,546 for the 2013 fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Audet is not concerned by this fluctuation in the company's number of customers.</seg>
<seg id="29">"For me, this does not indicate a change in trend," he noted.</seg>
<seg id="30">"It varies from one quarter to the next in the face of very lively competition."</seg>

<seg id="2">Ipswich Town have said they have received no approach from the Republic of Ireland for manager Mick McCarthy.</seg>
<seg id="3">McCarthy is second-favourite with bookmakers, behind Martin O'Neill, to replace Giovanni Trapattoni, who left the Republic job last month.</seg>

<seg id="1">A black box in your car?</seg>
<seg id="2">As America's road planners struggle to find the cash to mend a crumbling highway system, many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box that fits neatly by the dashboard of your car.</seg>
<seg id="3">The devices, which track every mile a motorist drives and transmit that information to bureaucrats, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and state planning offices to overhaul the outdated system for funding America's major roads.</seg>
<seg id="4">The usually dull arena of highway planning has suddenly spawned intense debate and colorful alliances.</seg>
<seg id="5">Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying to allow government to use the little boxes to keep track of the miles you drive, and possibly where you drive them - then use the information to draw up a tax bill.</seg>
<seg id="6">The tea party is aghast.</seg>
<seg id="7">The American Civil Liberties Union is deeply concerned, too, raising a variety of privacy issues.</seg>
<seg id="8">And while Congress can't agree on whether to proceed, several states are not waiting.</seg>
<seg id="9">They are exploring how, over the next decade, they can move to a system in which drivers pay per mile of road they roll over.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thousands of motorists have already taken the black boxes, some of which have GPS monitoring, for a test drive.</seg>
<seg id="11">This really is a must for our nation.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It is not a matter of something we might choose to do," said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, which is planning for the state to start tracking miles driven by every California motorist by 2025.</seg>
<seg id="13">There is going to be a change in how we pay these taxes.</seg>
<seg id="14">The technology is there to do it.</seg>
<seg id="15">The push comes as the country's Highway Trust Fund, financed with taxes Americans pay at the gas pump, is broke.</seg>
<seg id="16">Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.</seg>
<seg id="17">Cars get many more miles to the gallon.</seg>
<seg id="18">The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, hasn't gone up in 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="19">Politicians are loath to raise the tax even one penny when gas prices are high.</seg>
<seg id="20">"The gas tax is just not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.</seg>
<seg id="21">His state recently put tracking devices on 500 cars to test out a pay-by-mile system.</seg>
<seg id="22">"This works out as the most logical alternative over the long term," he said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Wonks call it a mileage-based user fee.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is no surprise that the idea appeals to urban liberals, as the taxes could be rigged to change driving patterns in ways that could help reduce congestion and greenhouse gases, for example.</seg>
<seg id="25">California planners are looking to the system as they devise strategies to meet the goals laid out in the state's ambitious global warming laws.</seg>
<seg id="26">But Rep. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has said he, too, sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.</seg>
<seg id="27">The free marketeers at the Reason Foundation are also fond of having drivers pay per mile.</seg>
<seg id="28">"This is not just a tax going into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at Reason.</seg>
<seg id="29">People are paying more directly into what they are getting.</seg>
<seg id="30">The movement is also bolstered by two former U.S. Transportation secretaries, who in a 2011 report urged Congress to move in the pay-per-mile direction.</seg>
<seg id="31">The U.S. Senate approved a $90-million pilot project last year that would have involved about 10,000 cars.</seg>
<seg id="32">But the House leadership killed the proposal, acting on concerns of rural lawmakers representing constituents whose daily lives often involve logging lots of miles to get to work or into town.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several states and cities are nonetheless moving ahead on their own.</seg>
<seg id="34">The most eager is Oregon, which is enlisting 5,000 drivers in the country's biggest experiment.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of gas taxes to the state.</seg>
<seg id="36">Nevada has already completed a pilot.</seg>
<seg id="37">New York City is looking into one.</seg>
<seg id="38">Illinois is trying it on a limited basis with trucks.</seg>
<seg id="39">And the I-95 Coalition, which includes 17 state transportation departments along the Eastern Seaboard (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how they could go about implementing the change.</seg>
<seg id="40">The concept is not a universal hit.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers' cars were equipped with the devices not long ago, drivers were uneasy about the government being able to monitor their every move.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Concerns about Big Brother and those sorts of things were a major problem," said Alauddin Khan, who directs strategic and performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.</seg>
<seg id="43">It was not something people wanted.</seg>
<seg id="44">As the trial got underway, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "It would be fairly easy to turn these devices into full-fledged tracking devices."</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no need to build an enormous, unwieldy technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of individuals' everyday comings and goings.</seg>
<seg id="46">Nevada is among several states now scrambling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to keep track of how many miles a car is being driven, but not exactly where and at what time.</seg>
<seg id="47">If you can do that, Khan said, the public gets more comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="48">The hunt for that technology has led some state agencies to a small California startup called True Mileage.</seg>
<seg id="49">The firm was not originally in the business of helping states tax drivers.</seg>
<seg id="50">It was seeking to break into an emerging market in auto insurance, in which drivers would pay based on their mileage.</seg>
<seg id="51">But the devices it is testing appeal to highway planners because they don't use GPS and deliver a limited amount of information, uploaded periodically by modem.</seg>
<seg id="52">"People will be more willing to do this if you do not track their speed and you do not track their location," said Ryan Morrison, chief executive of True Mileage.</seg>
<seg id="53">There have been some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs.</seg>
<seg id="54">There are a lot less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this.</seg>
<seg id="55">In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers different choices.</seg>
<seg id="56">They can choose a device with or without GPS.</seg>
<seg id="57">Or they can choose not to have a device at all, opting instead to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles driven by all state residents.</seg>
<seg id="58">Other places are hoping to sell the concept to a wary public by having the devices do more, not less.</seg>
<seg id="59">In New York City, transportation officials are seeking to develop a taxing device that would also be equipped to pay parking meter fees, provide "pay-as-you-drive" insurance, and create a pool of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic.</seg>
<seg id="60">"Motorists would be attracted to participate because of the value of the benefits it offers to them," says a city planning document.</seg>
<seg id="61">Some transportation planners, though, wonder if all the talk about paying by the mile is just a giant distraction.</seg>
<seg id="62">At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area, officials say Congress could very simply deal with the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by raising gas taxes.</seg>
<seg id="63">An extra one-time or annual levy could be imposed on drivers of hybrids and others whose vehicles don't use much gas, so they pay their fair share.</seg>
<seg id="64">"There is no need for radical surgery when all you need to do is take an aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, the commission's director of legislation and public affairs.</seg>
<seg id="65">If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a host of other things.</seg>

<seg id="4">Kerry noted the $6 million the U.S. has contributed to the effort.</seg>
<seg id="5">Earlier in the day, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons - the international body monitoring Syria's destruction of chemical weapons - announced that Syria had met its Friday deadline in destroying or disabling all of its declared facilities for producing chemical weapons.</seg>
<seg id="6">The announcement came just over two months after the massive chemical attack outside Damascus on Aug.</seg>

<seg id="1">Barack Obama to Meet Iraqi Prime Minister as Violence Rages</seg>
<seg id="2">The American President will receive the Iraqi Prime Minister, Nouri Al Maliki, who is seeking the United States' help in the struggle against the strongest wave of violence in five years, on 1 November 2013, .</seg>
<seg id="3">October was the bloodiest month in Iraq in five and a half years, according to figures published by the Iraqi authorities on Friday, 01 November.</seg>
<seg id="4">964 people (of which 855 civilians, 65 policemen and 44 soldiers) were killed in acts of violence during October and 1,600 people were injured.</seg>
<seg id="5">The UN has reported even higher numbers with 979 dead and 1,902 injured.</seg>
<seg id="6">The violence is becoming more and more deadly in spite of reinforced security measures and large-scale military operations undertaken in recent months by Nouri Al Maliki's government, which is dominated by Shiites.</seg>
<seg id="7">The total number of deaths in October is the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="8">About two years after the withdrawal of American troops, the level of violence brings renewed fears of unrest while the country's neighbor, Syria, is in the grip of civil war.</seg>
<seg id="9">Bombs strike markets, mosques, weddings and funeral ceremonies.</seg>
<seg id="10">People are attacked in the street and even at home, and the security forces are also frequent targets of the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="11">The growing discontent among the Sunni minority, which held power under Saddam Hussein and is now complaining of being politically marginalized and being the target of unjust arrests, has favored this outburst of violence.</seg>
<seg id="12">On Friday, the latest acts of violence left four people dead in the north of Iraq, a day after at least 26 people were killed in a series of attacks, which included five booby-trapped cars being blown up in the north of Baghdad.</seg>
<seg id="13">The majority of the violence is attributed to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (EIIL), a group affiliated with Al-Qaida (Sunni extremists), which is also involved in the civil war in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Nouri Al Maliki wants a "global war" against Al-Qaida.</seg>
<seg id="15">The violence is at the centre of the talks in the United States with Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, who will be received by President Barack Obama on Friday, two years after their last meeting on 12 December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="16">At that time, the American President, who was elected on the promise of bringing to an end the US' military involvement in the country, painted an optimistic picture of the situation.</seg>
<seg id="17">Since arriving in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has met several government officials and members of Congress.</seg>
<seg id="18">On Thursday, he pleaded that the international community should conduct a "third world war" against Al-Qaida.</seg>
<seg id="19">The principle of security aid for Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, they have also criticized Shiite Nouri Al Maliki, saying he is partly responsible for the resumption of violence because of his "sectarian and authoritarian policies".</seg>
<seg id="21">They have also demanded that Barack Obama make Nouri Al Maliki understand that "the pernicious influence of Iran within the Iraqi government constitutes a serious problem in the relationship between our two countries".</seg>

<seg id="2">Edward Snowden, the US intelligence whistleblower, has declared that he is willing to travel to Berlin to give evidence to the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander fail to provide answers about its activities.</seg>
<seg id="3">German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele on Thursday met Mr Snowden in Russia, where he has been granted asylum, to discuss him testifying in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="4">A letter from Mr Snowden, presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by the MP, said: "Though the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as defection, and seeks to criminalise political speech with felony charges that provide no defence."</seg>
<seg id="5">However, speaking the truth is not a crime.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the letter, Mr Snowden said he believed the support of the international community could persuade the US government to abandon criminal charges against him.</seg>
<seg id="7">The charges filed by the US justice department include espionage and theft of government property.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hans-Peter Friedrich, German interior minister, told Zeit Online: "If Mr Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find ways to make this possible."</seg>
<seg id="9">Relations between the US and Germany have come under strain following claims that the NSA bugged Chancellor Angela's Merkel's phone.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary panel that oversees intelligence, said that if there were an opportunity to hear Mr Snowden as a witness "without bringing him into danger and completely ruining relations with the US," it should be taken.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr Ströbele, an MP for Germany's Green party, published a picture of himself with Mr Snowden on his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="12">He was accompanied on his visit to Russia by two German journalists.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr Ströbele said that, according to the former NSA contractor's lawyer, Mr Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left.</seg>
<seg id="14">If Mr Snowden testified in Germany he would need assurances that he would be "safe" there, the MP said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Snowden said in his letter that he had faced a "severe and sustained" campaign of persecution that forced him from his home.</seg>
<seg id="16">However he said that he was heartened by the worldwide response to "my act of political expression."</seg>
<seg id="17">Citizens around the world as well as high officials - including in the United States - have judged the revelation of an unaccountable system of pervasive surveillance to be a public service.</seg>
<seg id="18">The letter extends an offer to cooperate with German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved."</seg>

<seg id="3">Robert Warnock could play his first game for the season against West Coast on Saturday night.</seg>
<seg id="4">Carlton coach Mick Malthouse patrols the boundary line.</seg>
<seg id="5">MICK Malthouse - the man lured to Carlton to land the club's 17th flag on a deal worth millions - says it's not about wins and losses.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Blues have lost their opening three matches and face West Coast on Saturday night in Perth.</seg>
<seg id="7">A loss to the Eagles would mean Carlton would have to defy history to play finals - no side under the eight-team finals format has played in September after starting 0-4.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It's not about win-loss, it's about process," Malthouse said.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's the process, it'll always be the process.</seg>
<seg id="10">And when you look after the process, the results will look after themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">""People will love to go, 'Look at your scoreline'.</seg>
<seg id="12">Let's look at it.</seg>
<seg id="13">We're two games out of the eight, or one game, I don't even know what the ladder is.</seg>
<seg id="14">So what's the big deal?</seg>
<seg id="15">Ron Reed: We don't care about processes, Mick</seg>
<seg id="16">""It's are we playing good football?</seg>
<seg id="17">Yes we are, in patches.</seg>
<seg id="18">Are we playing good enough to beat our opponents?</seg>
<seg id="19">No, because we're not doing that for a full game.</seg>
<seg id="20">When it was suggested that Carlton supporters would be wanting a win soon, Malthouse said he would not be panicked.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Win game one to game 22, that's the supporters," Malthouse said.</seg>
<seg id="22">I can't help the supporters.</seg>
<seg id="23">All I can do is help the side.</seg>
<seg id="24">""The supporters are there, we love the supporters, we want to get 50,000 members.</seg>
<seg id="25">We're zip and three, what do you want me to do, turn it around?</seg>
<seg id="26">It's got to be process driven.</seg>
<seg id="27">In VFL-AFL history only four teams have started 0-4 and made the finals; North Melbourne in 1975 in a 12-team competition was the only side to go on to win the flag.</seg>
<seg id="28">The Blues were considering recalling Levi Casboult and Rob Warnock to cover for injured ruckman Matthew Kreuzer (thumb) against the tall Eagles.</seg>
<seg id="29">Warnock's 2012 season was ruined by a shoulder injury.</seg>
<seg id="30">He hasn't played since Round 14.</seg>
<seg id="31">Jarrad Waite and Eddie Betts are not expected to play this weekend.</seg>
<seg id="32">Malthouse defended captain Marc Murphy, who has been criticised for his defensive efforts, which Geelong exposed last week when Taylor Hunt kicked three goals on him.</seg>

<seg id="1">NRL SuperCoach off-season study guide: Fullback and bench spot open at Bulldogs</seg>
<seg id="2">SUPERCOACH opportunities at the Bulldogs centre on Ben Barba's vacant fullback slot and a possible forward cheapie.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fantasy coaches across the globe will be sweating on who wears Barba's No.</seg>
<seg id="4">1 jersey at Belmore, while the departures of Martin Taupau and Dene Halatau (both heading to the Tigers) could create space for a bargain option on the bench.</seg>
<seg id="5">But compared to other reams, the Bulldogs offer few quality SuperCoach options for 2014.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, at this early stage, it appears many teams will start the season without any Bulldogs.</seg>
<seg id="7">Over the next few weeks, we'll be analysing every team and revealing the essential opportunities to take advantage of in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="8">Watch this space - in particular this SuperCoach section. ***</seg>
<seg id="9">Ben Barba's fullback spot is open.</seg>
<seg id="10">In: Chase Stanley (Dragons), Reni Maitua (Eels), Pat O'Hanlon (Eels) Out: Ben Barba (Broncos), Paul Carter (Titans), Danny Galea (Widnes), Dene Halatau (Tigers), Kris Keating (Hull), Martin Taupau (Wests Tigers), Steve Turner (retired) New contracts: Josh Reynolds (2017), Aiden Tolman (2017), Greg Eastwood (2016), Dale Finucane (2016), Trent Hodkinson (2015), Josh Jackson (2016), David Klemmer (2016), Frank Pritchard (2016) Future to be decided: Drury Low, Joel Romelo, Tim Browne, Junior Palau</seg>
<seg id="11">Fullback: Ben Barba's fullback spot is up for grabs.</seg>
<seg id="12">But SuperCoach-wise, Barba's move to the Broncos may not offer much.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Bulldogs are shopping around for a replacement.</seg>
<seg id="14">Blake Ferguson, Kevin Locke, Josh Hoffman and Jarryd Hayne have been mentioned, but none offer big SuperCoach value given they are established players (although a class player like Hayne is likely to improve on his 60 average from last year - his worst SuperCoach performance since the game was created in 2008).</seg>
<seg id="15">Perhaps the best option SuperCoach-wise would be for Josh Morris to take over fullback duties, with a cheapie to score a backline spot.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, Canterbury appear unlikely to blood a back given depth includes Krisnan Inu, Tim Lafai, Mitch Brown and recruit Chase Stanley.</seg>
<seg id="17">Martin Taupau will play for the Tigers in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="18">Source: DailyTelegraph</seg>
<seg id="19">The bench: With Martin Taupau and Dene Halatau (both Tigers) having left, bench spots are open.</seg>
<seg id="20">Expect recruit Reni Maitua (Eels) to grab one.</seg>
<seg id="21">2012 Toyota Cup Player of the Year David Klemmer doesn't make a top 17 (see below) at this stage, but will no doubt play plenty of NRL when injuries are taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="22">He only played four NRL games last year, but showed some serious SuperCoach promise in limited game time, producing 1.11 points per minute.</seg>
<seg id="23">That said, Klemmer won't start at a bargain basement price (probably around the $130,000 mark) and there will likely be better cheap guys emerge closer to the season start.</seg>
<seg id="24">PREDICTED BEST 17: Josh Morris, Mitch Brown, Tim Lafai, Krisnan Inu, Sam Perrett, Josh Reynolds, Trent Hodkinson, Aiden Tolman, Michael Ennis, James Graham, Josh Jackson, Frank Pritchard, Greg Eastwood.</seg>
<seg id="25">Interchange: Sam Kasiano, Tony Williams, Dale Finucane, Reni Maitua</seg>
<seg id="26">David Klemmer has already drawn comparisons to Glenn Lazarus.</seg>
<seg id="27">Picture: Isabella Moore Source: The Daily Telegraph</seg>
<seg id="28">BARGAIN BASEMENT: CHEAPIES ANALYSIS Aside from David Klemmer, the best cheapie option may be youngster Lachlan Burr.</seg>
<seg id="29">He'd only get a run if there was a serious injury crisis, but he averaged a massive 1.44 PPM in his only first grade game last year.</seg>
<seg id="30">He made five hit-ups over eight metres in just nine minutes.</seg>
<seg id="31">That said, the fact this recommendation is based on such limited game time means SuperCoaches are seriously clutching at straws to find cheapies at the Bulldogs.</seg>
<seg id="32">The line-up here is way too settled.</seg>
<seg id="33">Josh Morris finished 2013 at fullback.</seg>
<seg id="34">SLEEPING GIANTS: PLAYERS SET TO STEP IT UP Josh Morris: As tends to be the case when centre/wingers are given a run at fullback, Morris produced some great numbers in the No.</seg>
<seg id="35">1 jersey at the end of 2013.</seg>
<seg id="36">He will start cheap following a quiet year on the try front (he only notched five), but there are probably better buys in the position for a similar price (think Anthony Milford, Ben Barba etc.).</seg>
<seg id="37">He could be a sleeper at centre/wing, but that would mean straying from the tried and trusted "guns and rookies" strategy.</seg>
<seg id="38">Predicted start price: $190,000.</seg>
<seg id="39">Predicted end price: $220,000.</seg>
<seg id="40">2013 average: 46.</seg>
<seg id="41">Predicted 2014 average: 52</seg>
<seg id="42">Tony Williams was ordinary for the Bulldogs in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="43">NO GO ZONE: PLAYERS TO AVOID Tony Williams: Burned many SuperCoaches with his poor 2013.</seg>
<seg id="44">There is no doubt Williams has huge potential (he averaged 70 in 2012) but when you throw in a propensity for injury, he's too much of a risk for long-form SuperCoach.</seg>
<seg id="45">While it's hard to see him going worse than last year, he's only a bye period purchase at best.</seg>
<seg id="46">Predicted start price: $205,000.</seg>
<seg id="47">Predicted end price: $230,000.</seg>
<seg id="48">2013 average: 48.</seg>
<seg id="49">Predicted 2014 average: 55.</seg>
<seg id="50">James Graham in action for the Bulldogs.</seg>

<seg id="52">TRAPS: LOOK TEMPTING, WON'T DELIVER James Graham: A very solid SuperCoach performer and contender for your side at some stage depending on bye schedule.</seg>
<seg id="53">But he's not an option from round one given he can't quite match it with the top SuperCoach props since the addition of attacking stats to the scoring.</seg>
<seg id="54">Paul Gallen, Andrew Fifita, Trent Merrin, Sam Burgess, Aaron Woods and co. are all bigger priorities to start the season.</seg>
<seg id="55">Predicted start price: $290,000.</seg>
<seg id="56">Predicted end price: $290,000.</seg>
<seg id="57">2013 average: 66.</seg>

<seg id="1">George Osborne: No RBS pre-election shares giveaway</seg>
<seg id="2">The bank which was bailed out with more than £46bn bailout at the height of the financial crisis this morning announced a third-quarter pre-tax loss of £634m.</seg>
<seg id="3">Mr Osborne announced that the bank would not be creating a separate stae owned "bad" bank but would rather ring-fence £38bn in toxic assents inside the bank in an area re-named RBS Capital Resolution Group.</seg>
<seg id="4">The former governor Bank of England Mervyn King had recommended moving RBS's toxic assets to a wholly separate bank that would be owned 100 percent by the state.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Mr Osborne said the current head of the Bank of England Mark Carney supported the idea of ring fencing the assets inside the bank.</seg>
<seg id="6">Mr Osborne said: "We are removing those mistakes of the past, if you like, putting them into a separate bad bank in RBS."</seg>
<seg id="7">""My absolute determination is to get back the money that the British taxpayer put in...""</seg>
<seg id="8">""Hopefully and eventually we will get our money back.""</seg>
<seg id="9">RBS was also criticised this morning for it's lending to small and medium businesses in a damning report commissioned by the bank from former deputy governor of the Bank of England, Sir Andrew Large.</seg>

<seg id="1">Great Opposition to Medically-Assisted Death at Palliative Care Congress</seg>
<seg id="2">The Canadian Palliative Care Congress, holding in Ottawa this week, comes several days after the vote in favour of the bill on medically-assisted death in Quebec.</seg>
<seg id="3">Several palliative care associations used the opportunity to restate their disapproval.</seg>
<seg id="4">"If every ill person had access to effective care to relieve their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very  few of them would wish to end their lives," said a spokesperson for the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.</seg>
<seg id="5">"If emphasis was put on palliative care in Canada, the call for euthanasia would become minimal," she added.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chairperson of the Quebec Palliative Care Network also rejects the bill on medically-assisted death.</seg>
<seg id="7">Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences for future generations if it is adopted.</seg>
<seg id="8">"What is the meaning of life?" she laments.</seg>
<seg id="9">The majority of palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die, according to the vice-president of the Alliance of Palliative Care Homes, Suzanne Fitzback.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mrs Fitzback, who is also the director of the Mathieu-Froment-Savoie Home in Gatineau, thinks the service would be useless anyway.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Nobody ever says to us: 'I want to die, give me an injection."</seg>
<seg id="12">The director of the Palliative Care Association of Ontario, Rick Firth, believes that the Quebec bill is confusing people with regard to the purpose of palliative care.</seg>
<seg id="13">He does not believe that Ontario will follow suit.</seg>
<seg id="14">Meanwhile, the liberal MP of Gatineau, Stephanie Vallee, thinks that the concept of termination of life needs to be clarified before the bill can be adopted.</seg>

<seg id="1">Kate Winslet Stars in "Labor Day"</seg>
<seg id="2">On the first day of filming "Labor Day," her new movie, Kate Winslet had a chat with Gattlin Griffith, the 14-year-old actor playing her son.</seg>
<seg id="3">"He was terrified," she recalled.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I just said to him, "You're really nervous, aren't you?""</seg>
<seg id="5">"And I said, "If it's any consolation, so am I and so is Josh, and that" - here she used a robustly off-color noun - "over there, he's the most terrified of them all." " (Josh was Josh Brolin, Ms. Winslet's co-star; the other person across the way was Jason Reitman, the director.)</seg>
<seg id="6">She started relatively young herself, with no formal training, and was just 19 when she delivered an electrifying performance as a New Zealand teenager whose fevered passion propels her into a terrible crime in the 1994 film "Heavenly Creatures."</seg>
<seg id="7">She has since played a careerful of interesting characters, including a spoiled rich girl ("Titanic"), a haunted former Nazi ("The Reader"), a troubled suburban wife ("Revolutionary Road"), a free spirit in and out of love ("Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind") and the young Iris Murdoch ("Iris").</seg>
<seg id="8">But she knows how it feels to learn on the job and also how it feels to be overwhelmed.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I know this age very well," Ms. Winslet continued, speaking of her young co-star.</seg>
<seg id="10">They have a billion questions every day, and they don't know who the hell to ask.</seg>
<seg id="11">I wanted him to know that he could ask me what was going on at any time.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was September, and Ms. Winslet had just introduced "Labor Day," a romance of sorts based on a 2009 Joyce Maynard novel, to an audience at a screening in a Manhattan hotel.</seg>
<seg id="13">During a free hour, she bounded into a meeting room, as much as anyone who is very pregnant and wearing very spiky stilettos can bound.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Do you mind if I take my shoes off?" she asked.</seg>
<seg id="15">Fizzing with energy, her blond hair in a ponytail, her stomach round and her skin glowing, she was dressed all in black - stretchy top, pants and a fetching tuxedo jacket.</seg>
<seg id="16">Meeting Ms. Winslet is a slightly disorienting experience.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the one hand, she is disarming, so instantly intimate, so easy and cozy.</seg>
<seg id="18">On the other hand, she is so deadly serious about her job.</seg>
<seg id="19">Regularly described by directors and critics as one of the greatest actresses of her generation, she has six Academy Award nominations (she won once, for "The Reader") and a reputation for being ultraprepared, ultraprofessional, without vanity, uncannily intuitive and willing to delve almost painfully deeply into her characters.</seg>
<seg id="20">"She has a real power, both as an actress on screen - she's so believable, and you're so connected to her emotionally - and as a person," said Neil Burger, who directed her in "Divergent," a science-fiction blockbuster to be released next year.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ms. Winslet, who is 38, took her younger co-stars in hand on this movie, too, he said.</seg>
<seg id="22">Among other things, she accomplished the seemingly impossible task of getting them to attend to the tasks in front of them rather than to their electronic devices.</seg>
<seg id="23">"They were young and distracted and scattered, like this lovely band of squirrels or wildcats, and she helped center them," Mr. Burger said.</seg>
<seg id="24">She feels that when you enter this sacred circle of acting, all of the other nonsense should go away.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Labor Day," which opens on Christmas, required all of Ms. Winslet's considerable powers of concentration.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is a powerful and intimate film in which her character, a single mother named Adele who is shattered by a string of miscarriages and her husband's rejection, and who is so frightened of the world she can barely leave the house, meets a sudden menace in the sinister, and then unexpectedly un-sinister, person of Mr. Brolin, an escaped convict.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the end, the movie is a love story.</seg>
<seg id="28">The film requires almost Shakespearean leaps of faith and motivation, and it requires Ms. Winslet to be many things at once: scared and strong, suspicious and open, tentative and decisive.</seg>
<seg id="29">"What's really tricky is to play vulnerability and hidden strength simultaneously," Mr. Reitman said in a telephone interview.</seg>
<seg id="30">"There are a lot of actors who can play strong, and a lot of actors who can play vulnerable," he added.</seg>
<seg id="31">And the question is: How do you combine them?</seg>
<seg id="32">How do you play a woman who was once beautifully strong and has gone through so much trauma and is so shaken but is ready to bloom again?</seg>
<seg id="33">When it comes to her career, Ms. Winslet can very occasionally seem overextended.</seg>
<seg id="34">(She most likely did not need to be in "The Holiday" (2006), a slight romantic comedy in which she ends up, improbably, with Jack Black.)</seg>
<seg id="35">But she has a good eye for the kind of characters - interesting, intelligent, complicated - that she wants to play, and said she was drawn to "Labor Day" in part because of the restraint of the script.</seg>

<seg id="1">'Dainty, but slightly aggressive': Roller girls get their skates on</seg>
<seg id="2">Roller derby is a full-contact sport played by women on roller skates</seg>
<seg id="3">The sport has been gaining momentum in Cape Town, South Africa</seg>
<seg id="4">A league of three teams has been set up, boasting women from all walks of life</seg>
<seg id="5">Organizers say the sport embraces strong, yet feminine, women</seg>
<seg id="6">Every week, Inside Africa takes its viewers on a journey across Africa, exploring the true diversity and depth of different cultures, countries and regions.</seg>
<seg id="7">Follow host Errol Barnett on Twitter and Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="8">Cape Town, South Africa (CNN) -- Off track, Tasneem Howa is a rather introverted young woman who works as a photographer in Cape Town.</seg>
<seg id="9">On track, however, she pulls on black tights and slips into roller skates to transform into "TazMEANian Devil" -- a hard-hitting, sharp-moving diva on wheels.</seg>
<seg id="10">"When I put on skates, it's a rush," she says.</seg>
<seg id="11">You get that, it's like freedom.</seg>
<seg id="12">You're skating and feeling the air; it's awesome.</seg>
<seg id="13">"TazMEANian Devil" is a proud member of the Rev'ettes, one of the three roller derby teams that take part in the women-only Cape Town Rollergirls league.</seg>
<seg id="14">Just like many of her teammates, she took up the sport after seeing the 2009 film "Whip It," starring and directed by Drew Barrymore.</seg>
<seg id="15">Read this: Boxing gives teens hope in crime hotspot</seg>
<seg id="16">"I watched the movie 'Whip It' -- I thought it was chicks bashing each other, getting all bloody, but it's a bit calmer than that," says "TazMEANian Devil."</seg>
<seg id="17">Quirky outfits</seg>
<seg id="18">Fast-paced and full-contact, roller derby involves endurance, teamwork and crashes -- all on wheels.</seg>
<seg id="19">As much a bump-and-bruise sport as a lifestyle, derby's alternative edge is on full-on display on the rink.</seg>
<seg id="20">Roller girls typically don colorful skates, protective pads and quirky outfits as they race on a flat oval track, body checking each other to impede opponents from earning points for their team.</seg>
<seg id="21">"You can be dainty but need to be slightly aggressive at the same time," says Ming-Cheau Lin, a.k.a "Wolverming," who plays for Cape Town's Storm Riders.</seg>
<seg id="22">In line with the hard-hitting sport's tradition, players also adopt certain monikers chosen to reflect their on-track alter ego.</seg>
<seg id="23">"One of the most important things about roller derby is your derby name," explains Shawn Graaff, who founded Cape Town Rollergirls in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="24">I know it seems kitsch and silly but it's something people get excited about and historically people had derby names because they didn't want to participate in such an aggressive spectacle sport and compromise their professional career.</seg>
<seg id="25">What is roller derby?</seg>
<seg id="26">Roller derby is a sport that requires strategy, team spirit and lots of body checking.</seg>
<seg id="27">A derby match, called a bout, is played by two teams consisting of jammers, who are the point scorers, and blockers, the team's line of defense.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal is for the jammers to get past the other team's blockers and then lap them.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once the jammer has done so, the team gets a point for every skater she passes.</seg>

<seg id="37">Roller derby first took off as a competitive sport in the United States in the 1930s but later evolved into a TV spectacle sport, much like WWE.</seg>
<seg id="38">Its popularity decreased in the 1980s but an all-women league in Texas helped re-invent the sport in the early 2000s, this time with a bigger emphasis on athleticism.</seg>
<seg id="39">Drew Barrymore's "Whip It" gave the sport attention around the world, including in South Africa, where its popularity has been growing steadily.</seg>
<seg id="40">The Cape Town Rollergirls league is made up of three teams -- the Rev'ettes, the Storm Riders and the Iron Meisies -- boasting a variety of female players, from working mothers and students to locals and ex-pats.</seg>
<seg id="41">Men are only involved in a coaching or refereeing capacity.</seg>
<seg id="42">Graaff says the sport is helping break stereotypes, crashing any notions that women can't be both tough and feminine.</seg>

<seg id="54">This will be the first time the organization visits Africa and the Cape Town Rollergirls are excited about the possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="55">It's a nod to how seriously these players view their sport and will hopefully push them to grow into a bigger brand.</seg>
<seg id="56">And of course, there will be more bruises along the way.</seg>

<seg id="2">The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in an American drone strike in Pakistan on Friday, according to security services.</seg>
<seg id="3">Hakimullah Mehsud's death has been announced several times before in the past.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, intelligence personnel, army staff and political activists have confirmed this time that he has lost his life in the strike, which was carried out in the region of North Waziristan.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nice chap, James Blake, but what is the point of the Mercury Prize?</seg>
<seg id="2">The soft-spoken 25-year-old whose second effort, Overgrown, was deemed the best British album of the year, has all the qualities we should now find predictable in a Mercury winner.</seg>
<seg id="3">A nice young man, classically trained, Blake makes a brand of electronica at once inventive and palatable.</seg>
<seg id="4">If you're not familiar with it, expect layered synthesisers, rich vocal melodies and minimal electronic drums: a sound which some call modern and others find not vastly dissimilar to the noise Brian Eno and Roxy Music developed in around 1972.</seg>
<seg id="5">In short, the kind of music both acceptable to listen to at a summer music festival and to find residing in the CD player of your Mum's car (I speak from experience).</seg>
<seg id="6">Blake accepted the award with characteristic humility - gracing the podium for a mere 30 seconds to make the faintly ludic utterance "I'm going to thank my parents for showing me the importance of being self-sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="7">The kind of declaration, one presumes, that might just have easily made by an abandoned orphan searching for words in praise of an absent parent.</seg>
<seg id="8">Elsewhere, Oxford-based rockers Foals were thankfully on hand to offer up some much need comic relief - though even that was spiked with a fractious, familial flavour.</seg>
<seg id="9">When asked on how it would feel to beat fellow nominee David Bowie, frontman Yannis Philippakis said simply, "it'd be a little bit like punching your Dad."</seg>
<seg id="10">What is the point in the Mercury Music Prize, family feuds aside?</seg>
<seg id="11">Originally labelled an alternative to the Brits, those recently awarded the £20,000 - PJ Harvey, The xx and Elbow - are all signed to major labels and don't desperately require the cash or exposure.</seg>
<seg id="12">It does serve one clearly definable function: to inspire ire in those who aren't or, in some circumstances, are nominated.</seg>
<seg id="13">In a moment of brilliance, Damon Albarn-fronted Gorillaz called for their eponymous debut album to be retracted from the 2001 nominations.</seg>

<seg id="1">Afghanistan?</seg>
<seg id="2">Iraq?</seg>
<seg id="3">Nope, Dick Cheney doesn't believe in regrets</seg>
<seg id="4">Now, with a fine new heart, he is still thumping that old tub, calling for war on Iran, defending the torture of terror suspects - a practice he introduced.</seg>
<seg id="5">Il ne regrette rien.</seg>
<seg id="6">Alone of Bush's men, he has even been taken up by the Tea Party.</seg>
<seg id="7">He is in the news because he has just published a book about his medical woes, co-written with his cardiac surgeon.</seg>
<seg id="8">He had his first heart attack aged 37 when he was a freshman in Washington, chief of staff in President Ford's cabinet.</seg>
<seg id="9">A more prudent fellow would have gone back to Wyoming and found a less stressful occupation.</seg>
<seg id="10">After all, he had avoided previous life-threatening challenges, having obtained five deferments from fighting in Vietnam.</seg>
<seg id="11">But while that promised only death, Washington offered glory.</seg>
<seg id="12">Cheney went for it.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since then, he has survived four catheterisations, quadruple bypass surgery and finally a transplant to replace his original heart, which had swollen to the size of a football.</seg>
<seg id="14">Interviewed by Dr Sanjay Gupta, a medical doctor and TV journalist, he refused to be drawn by a reference to "numerous studies showing a link between heart condition and memory loss, depression, decline in decision-making ability and impaired cognition due to limited blood flow to the brain."</seg>
<seg id="15">I didn't know about it and I wasn't worried about it.</seg>
<seg id="16">This refusal to be bowed by his life-threatening disease is the key to his long-running popularity.</seg>
<seg id="17">He may have been passing through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, but his ashy pallor, gritted teeth and gravelly growl all said plainly that he was the meanest motherfucker in the valley.</seg>
<seg id="18">He was a political John Wayne for the anaemic post-Vietnam age, when US supremacy began to seem perilously poised.</seg>
<seg id="19">That defiant belligerence may also explain the disastrous policies for which history will hold him to account, culminating in the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="20">All showed a determination to stun the world with the brute reality of the US military, exploding the existing order but with no joined-up idea of what to replace it with.</seg>
<seg id="21">Perhaps in a period of medical calm he had a moment of clarity.</seg>
<seg id="22">The first Gulf war, which he oversaw as the first President Bush's Secretary for Defence, resulted in just 146 American dead, and the allies withdrew without seizing Baghdad or challenging Saddam's grip on power.</seg>
<seg id="23">Cheney explained why.</seg>
<seg id="24">Once you got to Iraq and took down Saddam Hussain's government, then what are you going to put in its place?</seg>
<seg id="25">It's a question people are still asking.</seg>
<seg id="26">It doesn't appear to have an answer, at least not one we can stomach.</seg>
<seg id="27">"If you take down the central government," he reasoned, "you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off."</seg>
<seg id="28">Dick Cheney seems to me the exemplary figure in America's decline, at the crucial moment when fear of humiliation and of losing the reputation of absolute supremacy blinds the faculties of reason.</seg>
<seg id="29">With that blind imperial rage goes a sort of twisted melancholy, something that reminds me of analogous figures in Britain's imperial recession from Curzon to Kipling, all animated by bitter nostalgia and with sadistic tendencies masquerading as patriotic obligation.</seg>
<seg id="30">Asked about waterboarding, Cheney once replied, "Tell me what terrorist attacks you would have let go forward because you didn't want to be a mean and nasty fellow?"</seg>
<seg id="31">Are you going to trade the lives of a number of people because you want to preserve your... honour?</seg>
<seg id="32">Too late for that, Mr Cheney.</seg>
<seg id="33">Twelve years ago, after the start of the Afghan bombing campaign, I travelled down the North-West Frontier, south of Islamabad, to find out what the local people thought of it.</seg>
<seg id="34">I stopped in the town of Tank, where Sir Mortimer Durand, the man who drew the artificial border between Pakistan and Afghanistan, was knocked from his elephant while going through a low arch, and killed.</seg>
<seg id="35">I was surrounded by a lively crowd.</seg>
<seg id="36">"We all support the Taliban here," I was told.</seg>
<seg id="37">I have no doubt they would say the same today.</seg>
<seg id="38">In essence the futility of this Afghan war, like the previous ones, is easily explained.</seg>
<seg id="39">The only way we can obtain local support is by purchasing it.</seg>
<seg id="40">A culture of corruption quickly sets in, to which the only antidote appears to be the claimed simplicity, honesty and piety of the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="41">This is what has put paid to us.</seg>
<seg id="42">"The English cannot win this war," a young man told me with a sinister smile, drawing his thumb across his throat.</seg>
<seg id="43">To repay these attacks we will do much harm to the English.</seg>

<seg id="1">DRC: Army Attacks Last Rebel Stronghold</seg>
<seg id="2">The diehards of the M23, who are several hundreds in number, had entrenched themselves at an altitude of almost 2,000 metres in the farmland hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, close to Bunagana and Jomba, two towns located around 80km north of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.</seg>
<seg id="3">"The fighting has not stopped since morning and is continuing despite the darkness," a resident of Jomba, according to whom a little girl had been injured by gunfire in the morning, told the AFP by telephone at around 12.30pm.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The fighting has slightly reduced in intensity. It appears that the Armed Forces of the DRC (FARDC) have pushed the rebels back a bit," he added.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to this witness, who chose to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "spent the night" in Jomba, before going into action for a "combing operation".</seg>
<seg id="6">The rattle of gunfire from light arms could clearly be heard in the background.</seg>
<seg id="7">From Bunagana, a political stronghold and last preserve of the rebellion to fall on Wednesday, an AFP journalist could hear the detonation of heavy arms.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to a source at the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the DRC (MONUSCO), the fighting has entered "the final phase": the FARDC has "surrounded the remaining M23 positions to flush them out".</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the resumption on Friday of confrontations between the March 23 Movement (M23) and the army, MONUSCO has not been participating directly in the fighting, but it is providing government's troops with critical support in terms of intelligence, observation and planning.</seg>
<seg id="10">At the end of the afternoon, several dozen well-equipped soldiers headed off towards the front.</seg>
<seg id="11">They were armed with Kalashnikovs and rocket launchers.</seg>
<seg id="12">A little earlier, on the road to Bunagana, the frontier post with Uganda, soldiers assisted by civilians loaded up a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a brand new truck belonging to the FARDC, intended to take over from another device pounding the positions of the M23 in the hills.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Congolese President, Joseph Kabila, called on the rebels once again on Wednesday to "stand down voluntarily" or be disarmed "by force", while leaving open the Kampala process, where Kinshasa and the M23 have been in discussions since December with no outcome as yet.</seg>
<seg id="14">The political leaders of the M23 are hoping to reach an agreement there.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We have finished the talks. The Ugandan mediators just need to organize the signing," asserted Roger Lumbala, vice-president of the M23 delegation, although this information could not be confirmed immediately with the government.</seg>
<seg id="16">The M23 was born of an April 2012 mutiny by former rebels, principally Tutsis who were integrated into the army in 2009 following a peace agreement.</seg>
<seg id="17">The UN and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23. Kigali and Kampala have denied the accusations.</seg>
<seg id="18">North Kivu is one of the most densely populated areas of the DRC, and its land abounds in coveted mineral resources.</seg>
<seg id="19">At Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, to which around 5,000 people fled between Monday and Wednesday according to the UN, the process of returning which started in the morning was reversed at midday.</seg>
<seg id="20">"This morning we went back across the border to go back to our fields, but the soldiers told us to go back," the AFP was told by Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by her nine children, including an infant on her back.</seg>
<seg id="21">The gunfire seems to be getting closer to the population.</seg>
<seg id="22">Early that evening, dozens of residents were crossing the border, some with mattresses on their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.</seg>

<seg id="1">FAA to allow air travelers to go the distance with electronic gadgets</seg>
<seg id="2">Ever-increasing baggage fees, vanishing leg room and invasive security screening measures have made air travel hellish for millions of passengers.</seg>
<seg id="3">Now the government is giving fliers more screen time with their gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Federal Aviation Administration announced Thursday that it will ease restrictions on the use of portable electronic devices during takeoffs and landings.</seg>
<seg id="5">Within a few weeks, travelers will be able to operate their iPads, Kindles and even smartphones throughout a commercial flight, though phone calls will still be banned.</seg>
<seg id="6">The agency has given in to the reality that most Americans aren't happy when denied these beloved digital companions, which pose little threat to safety on a plane, industry experts say.</seg>
<seg id="7">About 90% of airline passengers board a plane packing hand-held devices and laptops, and at least 40% said they would like to use those gadgets throughout the flight, according to a recent survey by the Consumer Electronics Assn., a trade group for the electronics industry.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The FAA had a blinding glimpse of the obvious," said Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst with consulting firm Hudson Crossing.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's nice for airlines to be able to give something back to their customers.</seg>
<seg id="10">He estimates the rule change will give passengers an extra 35 to 40 minutes per flight with their devices.</seg>
<seg id="11">For Ryan Middlekauff, the change in policy couldn't come soon enough.</seg>
<seg id="12">"When I'm on a plane, I don't want to talk to anyone," said the L.A. mortgage banker.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just let me plug in and leave me alone.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the FAA made it clear that cellphone calls from a plane are still forbidden because of concerns that cell signals might interfere with communications systems.</seg>
<seg id="15">The rule against using hand-held electronic devices on commercial flights has its roots in the early 1960s - an era of transistor radios, rotary phones and record players.</seg>
<seg id="16">At the time, the FAA was worried that signals could meddle with an aircraft's avionics.</seg>
<seg id="17">The rule, which previously called for passengers to pocket their devices on takeoffs and landings, until an airliner hits 10,000 feet, has been altered and updated over the years.</seg>
<seg id="18">But it wasn't until the recent rise in the popularity of digital technology that the FAA considered lifting the outdated restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="19">Under the new rule, passengers will be able to use devices that are switched to "airplane mode" and are not emitting a signal.</seg>
<seg id="20">Not everyone is happy with the change.</seg>
<seg id="21">Pilots worry that passengers won't shut their devices down during emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Air Line Pilots Assn., the world's largest pilot union that represents nearly 50,000 pilots, said it is concerned about relying on passengers to selectively turn off their devices during times of extremely poor weather.</seg>
<seg id="23">It "is not a practical solution," the association said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="24">We urge passengers to realize the potential seriousness of using a device at a time when any crew member - pilot or flight attendant - has advised them that it is unsafe to do so.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some flight attendants and travelers predict more delays and frustration caused by fliers who stumble onto planes with their eyes glued to a touch screen.</seg>
<seg id="26">Dwight Lewis, a retired store display manufacturer from El Segundo, said he already sees passengers ignoring the flight attendants' admonitions to shut down their smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="27">The rule change will only mean more passengers ignoring instructions from flight attendants, he said.</seg>
<seg id="28">"Since half the people don't follow the rules now, expect more when more devices are allowed," Lewis said.</seg>
<seg id="29">There are a lot of jerks flying that pay zero attention to what they are told to do.</seg>
<seg id="30">Still, flight attendants unions say they will work to implement the new rules to ensure passenger safety.</seg>

<seg id="3">The couple's lawsuit states Chad Hurley wasn't invited to the elaborate Oct.</seg>
<seg id="4">21 proposal at San Francisco's AT&T Park, but was allowed to stay because he signed an agreement not to post any video or images from the event.</seg>
<seg id="5">West allowed other cameras to film the event for possible broadcast on E!</seg>
<seg id="6">Entertainment Television, home to his fiancee's show "Keeping Up With the Kardashians," according to the suit.</seg>

<seg id="8">The video also showed the ensuing celebration with Kardashian's family and invited guests toasting the newly-engaged couple.</seg>
<seg id="9">Kardashian and West are seeking unspecified damages from Hurley and his company, Avos Systems Inc.</seg>

<seg id="2">Stephen Dank.</seg>
<seg id="3">A PHARMACIST who worked closely with Essendon's former sports scientist Stephen Dank is to co-operate with anti-doping investigators.</seg>
<seg id="4">The evidence of Nima Alavi, the compound pharmacist who prepared substances for Dank during his time at Essendon, is seen as crucial.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I am certainly planning to assist ASADA," he said in a statement to the Herald Sun.</seg>
<seg id="6">I am completely on board with them.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr Alavi, who runs South Yarra's Como Compounding Pharmacy, declined to comment any further.</seg>
<seg id="8">ASADA is examining both AFL and NRL clubs over concerns players may have been given banned substances in the nation's biggest ever sports doping scandal.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Herald Sun understands ASADA intends to apply its new coercive powers to Dank and up to three others.</seg>
<seg id="10">These powers can compel people to supply documents that are relevant to any ASADA investigation.</seg>
<seg id="11">Formal doping charges against the Bombers remain a possibility.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mr Alavi has intimate knowledge of which substances Dank was supplied with in 2011 and 2012, when he ran the Essendon Football Club's supplements program.</seg>
<seg id="13">There are still questions about whether the prohibited substance Thymosin beta 4, also known as TB4, was used.</seg>
<seg id="14">ASADA is building a circumstantial case that includes evidence from a media interview Dank gave in April, and correspondence from "Dr Ageless" biochemist Shane Charter, who sourced some substances for Dank and who worked with Mr Alavi.</seg>
<seg id="15">There has been continuing speculation about whether ASADA would formally issue infraction notices to the Bombers.</seg>
<seg id="16">Deputy AFL chief Gil McLachlan said in August it would take "definitive new evidence" for the Bombers to incur formal doping penalties.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr McLachlan was speaking after the AFL sanctioned Essendon for bringing the game into disrepute.</seg>
<seg id="18">The league fined the club $2 million and sidelined coach James Hird until 2015.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Bombers will be denied picks in the upcoming draft as part of their punishment over the supplements saga.</seg>

<seg id="2">1, 2013 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ --</seg>
<seg id="3">The Nature Conservancy has begun work to reconstruct Half Moon Reef, a once-massive oyster reef that has virtually disappeared over the last century in Matagorda Bay, one of the largest estuaries and most productive fisheries in Texas.</seg>
<seg id="4">During ...</seg>
<seg id="5">Using an innovative approach, the project will contribute to the resiliency of Matagorda Bay</seg>
<seg id="6">1, 2013 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The Nature Conservancy has begun work to reconstruct Half Moon Reef, a once-massive oyster reef that has virtually disappeared over the last century in Matagorda Bay, one of the largest estuaries and most productive fisheries in Texas.</seg>
<seg id="7">Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20131101/DC07842</seg>
<seg id="8">During November and December, crews will install three miles of limestone reef rows to create a 45-acre reef, approximately seven to eight feet beneath the bay surface.</seg>
<seg id="9">The project is being financed with a $3.8 million grant through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Coastal Impact Assistance Program, which is administered through the Texas General Land Office.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This really is an innovative approach to oyster reef construction," said Mark Dumesnil, associate director of coastal restoration for The Nature Conservancy in Texas, explaining the unique three-dimensional design of the reef and the 'domino effect' of benefits it will have.</seg>
<seg id="11">When you have healthy oyster reefs, you have excellent habitat for small fish and other reef-dependent species, reliable food for bigger fish and water filtration.</seg>
<seg id="12">All of that leads to healthier commercial and recreational fisheries, a first line of defense against storms and hurricanes, cleaner water and a more resilient ecosystem overall.</seg>
<seg id="13">Surveys from the early 1900s suggest the reef was once 400 acres.</seg>
<seg id="14">Several factors over the last century have led to its demise, including the release of a major log jam on the Colorado River in the 1930s that sent sediment flooding into Matagorda Bay; the rerouting of the Intracoastal Waterway in the 1940s; and Hurricane Carla, which pummeled the region in 1961.</seg>
<seg id="15">In addition, oyster shells became a popular construction material in the early 20th century; as dredging intensified, millions of cubic yards of oyster shell were removed from reefs hugging the Texas coast.</seg>
<seg id="16">This trend also played out on a global scale.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Today 85 percent of the world's oyster reefs have disappeared, making oysters among the most imperiled marine species on earth," said Dr. Jennifer Pollack, lead researcher on the project from Texas A&M Corpus Christi.</seg>
<seg id="18">The good news is that the Gulf of Mexico is widely considered as the last, best hope for a full comeback.</seg>
<seg id="19">As Texas concludes a third consecutive year of drought, Conservancy researchers are also keeping a close eye on how the reef will fare under extended drought conditions.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Matagorda is one of the largest estuaries in Texas - the freshwater that enters into the bay from Texas rivers and streams is crucial to its health," said Laura Huffman, Texas state director for The Nature Conservancy.</seg>
<seg id="21">We already know the reef can withstand drought conditions but what we want to test is whether it will help the entire bay system better tolerate periods of drought and low freshwater flows.</seg>
<seg id="22">"If we can prove that, this work will have relevancy for coastal cities struggling to manage their marine resources amid drier conditions and scarcer freshwater supplies worldwide," continued Huffman.</seg>
<seg id="23">A second phase of the project, administered and funded by the Army Corp of Engineers in partnership with the Conservancy, will restore 12 more acres of Half Moon Reef.</seg>

<seg id="1">CMC boss 'curries favour' to keep position</seg>
<seg id="2">The head of Queensland's independent corruption watchdog has been accused of acting like the government's puppet in a bid to be reappointed.</seg>
<seg id="3">Crime and Misconduct Commission acting chairman Dr Ken Levy wrote an unsolicited opinion piece on Thursday backing the state government's controversial anti-bikie laws.</seg>
<seg id="4">Members of the Parliamentary Crime and Misconduct Committee (PCMC), which oversees the CMC, told him on Friday morning he'd compromised his independence.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The opposition no longer has any confidence in you continuing as acting chair and I believe that your position now is untenable," Opposition Leader Annastacia Palaszczuk told him at a committee hearing.</seg>
<seg id="6">Independent MP Peter Wellington said the CMC chairman had used his position "to effectively become a puppet for the government."</seg>
<seg id="7">"I no longer have confidence in Dr Levy's independence heading the most powerful organisation in Queensland," he told AAP.</seg>
<seg id="8">Corruption fighter Tony Fitzgerald and civil libertarians also accused Dr Levy of bias and undermining the CMC's independence.</seg>
<seg id="9">Dr Levy defended himself, saying he'd confined comments to issues within the bounds of the CMC, which was tasked with fighting crime, including criminal bikie gangs.</seg>
<seg id="10">When asked whether he'd consulted anyone about the article, he said: "No, it's my composition."</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr Wellington said it appeared Dr Levy's opinion piece was "all about currying favour with the government."</seg>
<seg id="12">A call for nominations for a permanent CMC chair is due in about two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">The government's candidate must be approved by the PCMC, but that committee could be bypassed if the government simply extends Dr Levy's tenure as acting chairman.</seg>
<seg id="14">When asked on Friday if he would support Dr Levy's nomination as permanent chairman, Premier Campbell Newman said: "Of course."</seg>

<seg id="2">Police are hunting this man ...</seg>
<seg id="3">Thomas (Tom) Hibbs / Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied</seg>
<seg id="4">NSW Fair Trading and police are closing in a family of travelling con men who have ripped off at least two elderly people in the Illawarra in recent days.</seg>
<seg id="5">It comes as authorities warn that increasing numbers of English and Irish gypsies have turned their sights on vulnerable Aussies as summer approaches.</seg>
<seg id="6">Police are now on the hunt for Thomas Hibbs who is accused of trying to rip off an 86-year-old Oak Flats man on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr Hibbs and a partner offered to clean the octogenarian's driveway with a high pressure hose.</seg>
<seg id="8">He took up the offer and wrote a cash cheque for $700.</seg>
<seg id="9">It wasn't until the victim's son-in-law Trevor Dukes noticed damage to the driveway's stencil covering that the ruse was uncovered.</seg>
<seg id="10">"When I found out they asked for a cash cheque that's when I thought it smelt funny," Mr Dukes said.</seg>
<seg id="11">After he tried calling a mobile number on a business card the men had only to find it was disconnected he raced his father-in-law to the bank and had the cheque cancelled before the gypsies could have it cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="12">The next day another family member who worked at a local bank became aware that an elderly woman had withdrawn $2000 cash to pay handymen for work to her roof and driveway.</seg>
<seg id="13">She raced to the woman's house, but was too late.</seg>
<seg id="14">They are scum.</seg>
<seg id="15">They are just out there to target older people and make a killing," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">It's pretty low.</seg>
<seg id="17">Hibbs only entered the country last week and Fair Trading investigations director David Byrne said increasing number of con man were making their way to Australia from Ireland and the UK as summer approached.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We start to see them appearing in late Spring and early summer from the UK if they haven't already set up in Queensland earlier," Mr Byrne said.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mr Hibbs was well known to authorities, but there was nothing immigration could do to stop the con man coming back to Australia each year.</seg>
<seg id="20">"It's an ongoing issue we have, the offences they commit are not considered serious enough to stop them from re-entering the country," he said.</seg>
<seg id="21">Trevor Dukes says conman targeted his 86-year-old father-in-law.</seg>

<seg id="4">Stacy Martin's resemblance to her elder sister is striking: a twig-like figure, a transparent complexion and Franco-English origins.</seg>

<seg id="2">The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, Gazprom's chief said.</seg>
<seg id="3">"A landmark event has taken place today: Construction started on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the most large-scale and important project in Europe," Gazprom Chairman Alexei Miller said in a statement Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">This project is a key element of energy security of the whole European continent.</seg>
<seg id="5">South Stream is meant to add diversity to Russia's export routes through Europe.</seg>
<seg id="6">A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, which hosts most of Russia's gas for Europe, adds a layer of risk to conventional routes, officials say.</seg>
<seg id="7">Miller said the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated "forever."</seg>
<seg id="8">Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at a discounted rate once the entire project starts operating in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="9">Gazprom said construction should begin in other downstream countries by year's end.</seg>
<seg id="10">The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.</seg>

<seg id="2">The student body has, each time, been the target of an initiative that had a lot of success last season.</seg>

<seg id="2">Six Barclays traders and two from RBS have been suspended</seg>
<seg id="3">Investigation focuses on use of instant messaging to rig the market</seg>
<seg id="4">RBS vows to "come down very severely' on anyone caught breaking rules"</seg>
<seg id="5">Traders at Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland have been suspended over fixing claims.</seg>
<seg id="6">City watchdogs are probing reports of fixing of currency markets as part of a global investigation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Up to eight traders have reportedly become caught up in the inquiry to the currency market which is worth £3 trillion-a-day globally.</seg>
<seg id="8">As many as six traders at Barclays have reportedly been suspended in connection with claims of currency market fixing</seg>
<seg id="9">Barclays is said to have suspended as many as six foreign exchange traders and while RBS has put two of its traders on suspension.</seg>
<seg id="10">Both banks have declined to comment on the reports but confirmed they have been drawn into the investigations.</seg>
<seg id="11">RBS said in its third quarter results today it had been contacted by the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and other authorities.</seg>
<seg id="12">It added: "The group is reviewing communications and procedures relating to certain currency exchange benchmark rates as well as foreign exchange trading activity and is cooperating with these investigations."</seg>
<seg id="13">At this stage, the group cannot estimate reliably what effect, if any, the outcome of the investigation may have on the group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ross McEwan, RBS chief executive, refused to comment on the case, but said it will "come down very severely on anyone we discover has been breaking the rules."</seg>
<seg id="15">Meanwhile Barclays said it was also co-operating with inquiries from various authorities.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is reviewing its foreign exchange trading activities, over a period of several years to August this year.</seg>
<seg id="17">RBS boss Ross McEwan said it will 'come down very severely on anyone we discover has been breaking the rules'</seg>
<seg id="18">Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and UBS are also thought to have been contacted as part of the probe involving regulators in Britain, Switzerland, the US and Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="19">The FCA revealed last month it had launched its own investigation into the foreign exchange market, which is worth £3 trillion a day globally.</seg>
<seg id="20">It said it first sent out letters to firms in April, before launching a formal investigation later.</seg>
<seg id="21">Regulators are looking into whether currency traders shared information about their positions and knowledge of client orders through instant messages to rig the foreign exchange market in their favour.</seg>
<seg id="22">Currency exchange rates are set on a daily basis by analysing actual trading volumes at leading banks during a short time window.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is thought that traders could potentially influence exchange rates by pushing through large orders during the 60-second window to make a profit.</seg>
<seg id="24">Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and UBS are also thought to have been contacted as part of the probe involving regulators in Britain, Switzerland, the US and Hong Kong</seg>
<seg id="25">Even a small movement in exchange rates could affect the value of investments worldwide, including pension funds.</seg>
<seg id="26">It threatens to engulf the industry in yet another embarrassing scandal at a time when many financial firms are still battling to restore their reputations following the Libor rigging revelations.</seg>
<seg id="27">Barclays and RBS were both fined for their part in the Libor scandal, paying penalties of £290 million and £391 million respectively.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to the Bank for International Settlements, global foreign exchange activity rose to 5.3 trillion dollars (£3.3 trillion) a day this year, from four trillion dollars (£2.5 trillion) in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="29">London accounts for the bulk of currency trading, with 41 per cent of global turnover in the market, followed by the United States, which has a 19 per cent share, Singapore with 5.7 per cent, Japan with 5.6 per cent and Hong Kong with 4.1 per cent.</seg>

<seg id="2">Gai Waterhouse believes Doomben Cup hope Hippopus (left) can help beef up her Queensland Group 1 tally.</seg>

<seg id="4">THE formidable firm of Gai Waterhouse and Chris Munce will team up in Brisbane on Saturday, with the trainer convinced Doomben Cup hope Hippopus can beef up her Queensland Group 1 tally.</seg>
<seg id="5">Waterhouse has been one of racing's biggest names for two decades, but has enjoyed relatively limited success at Group 1 level in Queensland with only Juggler (1996 Doomben Cup), Zacheline (1998 Queensland Oaks) and Bentley Biscuit (2007 BTC Cup) winning at the elite level.</seg>
<seg id="6">Hippopus will be Waterhouse's first big-time Brisbane invader for this carnival and the stable has been infused with confidence by the giant-killing win of Anthony Cummings' three-year-old Your Song in the BTC Cup.</seg>
<seg id="7">Your Song will be retired to stud after racing in the Doomben 10,000 and Stradbroke Handicap (1400m), to stand at Widden Stud, with the Fastnet Rock colt set to be a big earner in the breeding barn.</seg>
<seg id="8">It continues a theme with champion three-year-old colts Pierro and All Too Hard also retired to stud in recent times.</seg>
<seg id="9">Hippopus, who won the VRC St Leger at his last start, will be best suited in the Queensland Derby (2400m) but Waterhouse likes the colt's chances in the Doomben Cup (2000m).</seg>
<seg id="10">"Gai wouldn't be sending him if she didn't think he was a realistic chance," Waterhouse's foreman Mark Newnham said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ideally he is better suited over further, as you saw in the St Leger (2800m) in Melbourne, but he has got enough speed in his legs to be very competitive on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="12">""Your Song certainly wasn't among the best couple of three-year-olds, he wasn't Pierro and he wasn't All Too Hard, but he got up to Brisbane and absolutely spanked them.</seg>
<seg id="13">It shows it is a very good three-year-old crop this season.</seg>
<seg id="14">Foreteller and Lights Of Heaven head Doomben Cup betting markets but bookmakers are taking no chances with the Waterhouse-Munce factor and have Hippopus on the fourth line of betting at $9.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Munce booking re-ignites his formidable combination with Waterhouse, with the duo combining to win the 2010 Caulfield Cup on Descarado and plenty of other big-race winners including Dance Hero in the 2004 Golden Slipper.</seg>
<seg id="16">That's a plus.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Muncey has got a terrific record for the stable over a number of years," Newnham said.</seg>
<seg id="18">He knows how Gai likes her horses ridden so he is an obvious choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Hippopus is a natural staying type of horse so he will be on pace.</seg>
<seg id="20">""He's been sharp enough to win over 1900m around Canterbury, and you've got to have a horse that can jump and travel to do that.</seg>
<seg id="21">Gai has had in mind the Derby for a while and thought this race was the best way to get him there.</seg>
<seg id="22">Munce said he was sure Waterhouse would have Hippopus primed for the cup.</seg>
<seg id="23">"You can always ride Gai's horses with confidence and I am sure Hippopus will be well placed," Munce said.</seg>

<seg id="1">MPs: European Arrest Warrant needs reform</seg>
<seg id="2">The European Arrest Warrant (EAW) is "fundamentally flawed" and the Government needs to go further with its reforms of the system, a group of influential MPs has warned.</seg>
<seg id="3">The EAW, introduced in 2004, allows a national judicial authority, such as a court, to get a suspect extradited between European Union member states.</seg>
<seg id="4">The fast-track arrest warrant is among 35 EU criminal justice measures the Government wants to retain - but the Home Secretary Theresa May has promised to change British law to prevent it being used to extradite UK nationals on trivial or dubious charges.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, the Home Affairs Select Committee has said it is concerned the reforms do not go far enough and has called for an urgent vote in the House of Commons on continued UK membership of the EAW.</seg>
<seg id="6">The committee's chair, Keith Vaz, said: "The EAW, in its existing form, is fundamentally flawed and has led to a number of miscarriages of justice with devastating consequences for those concerned."</seg>
<seg id="7">We welcome the Government's proposed reforms, but are concerned that they do not go far enough.</seg>
<seg id="8">In its report, the committee said some countries use the EAW simply to expedite their investigations, whereas others do so in pursuit of relatively minor crimes.</seg>
<seg id="9">It added that for these reasons the UK receives disproportionately more warrants than it issues.</seg>

<seg id="1">Dylan's Guitar From Newport To Be Auctioned in NYC</seg>
<seg id="2">(NEW YORK) - The sunburst Fender Stratocaster that a young Bob Dylan played at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival when he famously went electric, perhaps the most historic instrument in rock "n" roll, is coming up for auction, where it could bring as much as half a million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="3">Though now viewed as changing American music forever, Dylan's three-song electric set at the Rhode Island festival that marked his move from acoustic folk to electric rock "n" roll was met by boos from folk purists in the crowd who viewed him as a traitor.</seg>
<seg id="4">He returned for an acoustic encore with "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue."</seg>
<seg id="5">The guitar is being offered for sale Dec.</seg>
<seg id="6">6, Christie's told The Associated Press.</seg>
<seg id="7">Five lots of hand- and typewritten lyric fragments found inside the guitar case - early versions of some of Dylan's legendary songs - also are being sold.</seg>
<seg id="8">The lyrics have a pre-sale estimate ranging from $3,000 to $30,000.</seg>
<seg id="9">With a classic sunburst finish and original flat-wound strings, the guitar has been in the possession of a New Jersey family for nearly 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="10">Dylan left it on a private plane piloted by the owner's late father, Vic Quinto, who worked for Dylan's manager.</seg>
<seg id="11">His daughter, Dawn Peterson, of Morris County, N.J., has said her father asked the management company what to do with the guitar but nobody ever got back to him.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last year, she took it to the PBS show "History Detectives" to try to have it authenticated.</seg>
<seg id="13">The program enlisted the expertise of Andy Babiuk, a consultant to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and owner of an upstate New York vintage instrument shop, and Jeff Gold, a Dylan memorabilia expert.</seg>
<seg id="14">Both men, who appeared on the episode, unequivocally declared the artifacts belonged to Dylan.</seg>
<seg id="15">Babiuk took the instrument apart and also compared it to close-up color photos of the guitar taken at the 1965 festival.</seg>
<seg id="16">I was able to match the wood grain on the body of the guitar ... and the unique grain of the rosewood fingerboard.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Wood grains are like fingerprints, no two are exactly alike," Babiuk said in an interview.</seg>
<seg id="18">Based on the sum of the evidence, I was able to identify that this guitar was the one that Bob Dylan had played in Newport.</seg>
<seg id="19">Dylan's attorney and his publicist did not respond to email and phone requests for comment.</seg>
<seg id="20">Dylan and Peterson, who declined to be interviewed, recently settled a legal dispute over the items.</seg>
<seg id="21">The terms of the settlement were not disclosed but allowed Peterson to sell the guitar and lyrics, according to Rolling Stone, which wrote in July about Peterson's quest to authenticate the guitar.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Representatives for Bob Dylan do not contest the sale of the guitar, and are aware of Christie's plan to bring it to auction," a statement issued through Christie's said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Dylan has generally looked upon his instruments to convey his art, akin to a carpenter's hammer, Howard Kramer, curatorial director of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, said last year.</seg>
<seg id="24">"I don't think he's dwelled on a guitar he hasn't played for 47 years," he said.</seg>
<seg id="25">If he cared about it, he would have done something about it.</seg>
<seg id="26">Festival founder George Wein told the AP that when Dylan finished playing, Wein was backstage and told him to go back out and play an acoustic number because that's what people expected.</seg>
<seg id="27">Dylan said he didn't want to do it and said he couldn't because he only had the electric guitar.</seg>
<seg id="28">Wein called out for a loaner backstage and about 20 musicians raised their acoustic guitars to offer them.</seg>
<seg id="29">The lyrics for sale include "In the Darkness of Your Room," an early draft of "Absolutely Sweet Marie" from Dylan's "Blonde on Blonde" album, and three songs from the record's 1965 recording session that were not released until the 1980s: "Medicine Sunday" (the draft is titled "Midnight Train"), "Jet Pilot" and "I Wanna Be Your Lover."</seg>
<seg id="30">Dylan's "going electric changed the structure of folk music," the 88-year-old Wein said.</seg>
<seg id="31">"The minute Dylan went electric, all these young people said, "Bobby's going electric, we're going electric, too.""</seg>

<seg id="1">Nissan slashes profit outlook, reshuffles management</seg>
<seg id="2">Nissan Motor Co<7201.T> said Chief Operating Officer Toshiyuki Shiga would step aside from the No.2 post to a job handling external affairs in a management makeover as the company grapples with quality issues amid an ambitious drive to boost market share.</seg>
<seg id="3">Japan's second biggest automaker by sales volume said in a statement that Shiga, 60, would become vice chairman.</seg>
<seg id="4">Chief Executive Officer Carlos Ghosn will stay on.</seg>
<seg id="5">Ghosn has set aggressive expansion targets for Nissan to boost both global market share and its operating margin to 8 per cent by end-March 2017, but multiple recalls and a sales slowdown in China have a cast shadow over the plan.</seg>
<seg id="6">Nissan cut its net profit outlook for the year ending March 2014 by nearly 20 per cent to 355 billion yen, depressed by a sales slowdown in China and Southeast Asia and by a major vehicle recall it announced in September.</seg>
<seg id="7">Ghosn will attend an earnings briefing at Nissan's headquarters in Yokohama from 5:30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Our new management line-up and regional organisation will ensure the company has the executive team in place to deliver the profitable growth expected from the Nissan Power 88 mid-term plan," he said in a statement, referring to its expansion goals.</seg>
<seg id="9">To focus better on issues unique to each region, Nissan said it will also increase its number of regions to six from the current three.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among the changes, China will become an autonomous region and the Americas will be split into North and South Americas.</seg>
<seg id="11">Nissan has been showing signs of quality issues as it rapidly expands, conducting a series of recalls including one in September targeting nearly 1 million vehicles due to an accelerator sensor flaw.</seg>
<seg id="12">Nissan's makeover follows a similar shakeup at alliance partner Renault SA's <RENA.PA>.</seg>
<seg id="13">Nissan did not name a new COO, saying the responsibilities would be shared among three executives.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hiroto Saikawa will become Nissan's de facto No.2, staying on as Chief Competitive Officer to oversee areas including R&D, purchasing, manufacturing and the supply chain, Nissan said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Executive Vice President Andy Palmer will become Chief Planning Officer, a new post overseeing global sales.</seg>
<seg id="16">Executive Vice President Trevor Mann will become Chief Performance Officer responsible for running regional operations, Nissan said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Wallabies vice-captain Quade Cooper says setting an example for his brothers forced him to grow up</seg>
<seg id="2">A look at Quade Cooper's stunning comeback over the past year, rising from ARU outcast to Wallabies vice-captain.</seg>
<seg id="3">Quade Cooper calls the shots during a Wallabies training session in London this week.</seg>
<seg id="4">SETTING an example for his two young brothers forced Quade Cooper to "grow up" to become the reformed team man who now holds the Wallabies vice-captaincy.</seg>
<seg id="5">Cooper revealed that the inspiration for his dramatic turnaround 12 months after his international career appeared in jeopardy lay with his siblings Reuben, 13, and Moses, 11.</seg>
<seg id="6">In them, he saw the manifestation of his own character beginning to flower.</seg>
<seg id="7">Having riled the Wallabies dressing room with his "toxic environment" comments, and then being fined $40,000 for it, Cooper had two choices.</seg>
<seg id="8">He could pack his bags and run either overseas or to rugby league, or he could rebuild his rugby career through toil and regain respect through deed.</seg>
<seg id="9">In his measured drawl, Cooper explained how the process unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">"A big thing for me is having two little brothers, who are massive rugby fans and they look up to me as their hero, so to speak," Cooper said.</seg>
<seg id="11">I'm the one setting an example for them, and they've obviously got dreams as well.</seg>
<seg id="12">""If I can set a better example for them, away from the game and when they see me performing on the field, then it's easier for them to see the right path to take.</seg>
<seg id="13">More often than not, when they do step off the right path it's easier to bring them back on.</seg>
<seg id="14">""That's where I've looked at my life, and how I can contribute to theirs as well as contribute to the team.""</seg>
<seg id="15">Some still feel Cooper is not the right man to wear the Wallabies' No.</seg>
<seg id="16">10 jersey, believing a few of his past performances in key international games showed him to be flaky under pressure.</seg>
<seg id="17">But his national coach Ewen McKenzie and teammates, who praise the rehabilitated</seg>
<seg id="18">Cooper to a man, hold no such fears.</seg>
<seg id="19">Cooper is now the only five-eighth in any top-five ranked international rugby side to hold a formal leadership title, and this in a field featuring Dan Carter and Morne Steyn.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who would have believed such a thing exactly one year ago when Cooper was being heavily linked to the Brisbane Broncos and French rugby while negotiations stalled with the ARU.</seg>
<seg id="21">Cooper has learned that change can only come within.</seg>
<seg id="22">""You actually have to stop relying on other people to give you a wake-up call, you need to be able to teach yourself when you are drifting off the path to bring yourself back," he said."</seg>
<seg id="23">""Because if you're always relying on other people, at some point in time there might not be someone around to give you the tap on the shoulder.</seg>
<seg id="24">You need to make that tough decision yourself.</seg>
<seg id="25">""I don't know why or how it happened, but things happen for a reason.</seg>
<seg id="26">I look at the last 12 months as a great opportunity for me to improve myself as a rugby player and as a person.</seg>
<seg id="27">He hopes his friend James O'Connor, now embarking on his own transformation story with a new life in London after having his contract withdrawn by the ARU, can also block the destabilising noise.</seg>
<seg id="28">"When you stuff up or make an error in your life, there's always people with opinions," Cooper said.</seg>
<seg id="29">Quade Cooper watches a kick during a Wallabies training session in London this week.</seg>
<seg id="30">You've got opinions coming from left, right and centre.</seg>
<seg id="31">Sometimes it confuses you more because you don't know which one to take on board, sometimes you try to take everything on board, sometimes it can be a little too much information.</seg>
<seg id="32">""Sometimes you just need a bit of time to work things out for yourself.</seg>
<seg id="33">James has made the decision to come over here and play, get away from the distractions in Australia, hopefully that is a great decision and something I hope works out.""</seg>
<seg id="34">More so than any light bulb moment for Cooper, there was a gradual awakening to his impact on his brothers, and the acceptance of the discipline required to fulfil a rugby career of mountainous potential.</seg>
<seg id="35">""There was no point in time where I went, 'Oh, that's what I need to change', you just grow up," Cooper said."</seg>
<seg id="36">""You get to a point where things aren't going right for you, and why is that?</seg>
<seg id="37">You look at your whole life in general, look at things that are consistently going well for you and some of the things that aren't necessarily being very consistent, and what are the things you can change.""</seg>
<seg id="38">Ask anyone within the Queensland Reds and Wallabies camps, and Cooper has been walking the talk since the start of the year.</seg>
<seg id="39">And his improvements as a player are becoming more obvious by the week.</seg>
<seg id="40">What should alarm opponents is Cooper's new-found understanding that the very best athletes are those who consistently overcome adversity and doubt.</seg>
<seg id="41">Did he lose confidence when McKenzie surprisingly left him on the bench for the first two Tests of his tenure as Wallabies coach, in favour of Matt Toomua?</seg>
<seg id="42">""Not at all, because you have to respect that he is in a position where he's got to pick a team he feels is going to do the job for that week," Cooper said."</seg>
<seg id="43">""Credit to Matt for how he had gone about the Super Rugby season, he got first crack at the No.</seg>
<seg id="44">10 jersey.</seg>
<seg id="45">If you look at it from a team view, if you drop your bundle and get all upset about it, imagine the flow-on effect that would have to the 30 other guys in the team.</seg>
<seg id="46">""So I looked at it as an opportunity where I could have more time to work at my game, be positive around the team, and contribute to the team.</seg>
<seg id="47">More often than not, if you do the right thing and work as hard as possible your opportunity will come.</seg>
<seg id="48">And you should be in a position to grab it with two hands and get your spot back, and that's what I will continue to try to do.</seg>

<seg id="1">New York's stop-and-frisk ruling blocked</seg>
<seg id="2">NEW YORK - In a highly unusual move, an appeals court Thursday blocked a judge's ruling that would have required changes to New York's controversial stop-and-frisk policy and also removed the judge from the case.</seg>
<seg id="3">U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin had declared the New York City Police Department's stop-and-frisk policy unconstitutional on Aug.</seg>
<seg id="4">12, and had ordered a court-appointed monitor to oversee a series of changes to the program.</seg>
<seg id="5">But after New York City appealed that ruling, the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals placed a stay on it, in effect halting those changes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In its opinion, the appeals court said Scheindlin "ran afoul" of a code of conduct for judges for a number of reasons, including media appearances that called her impartiality into question.</seg>
<seg id="7">The ruling comes just days before a New York City mayoral election in which candidate Bill de Blasio, who is leading in the polls by a wide margin, has indicated he would alter the stop-and-frisk program, if not end it completely.</seg>
<seg id="8">Experts also say De Blasio is likely to drop the city's appeal, which may make this ruling gratuitous.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is "extremely unusual" for an appeals court to remove a judge from a case, said James Cohen, a professor of law at Fordham University.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's a real slap in the face for her.</seg>
<seg id="11">Stop-and-frisk, which permits police to stop people they suspect of wrongdoing and search them, has been a contentious issue in New York.</seg>
<seg id="12">Some leaders argue that it is one of the reasons the city's crime rates have fallen dramatically: 62% between 1995 and 2011, according to FBI statistics.</seg>
<seg id="13">But critics say the policy permits racial profiling.</seg>
<seg id="14">Thursday's ruling also comes one day after New York Police Department Commissioner Raymond Kelly was heckled off the stage during an appearance at Brown University in Providence, R.I., where students chanted, "No justice, no peace!"</seg>
<seg id="15">"No racist police!" in a reference to stop-and-frisk.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the case being appealed, Floyd, et al. vs. City of New York, attorneys for the plaintiffs argued that stop-and-frisk violated the rights of minority New Yorkers to equal protection under the law, with nearly 90% of all people stopped in the program black or Latino.</seg>
<seg id="17">New York City and the NYPD had argued that the majority of people stopped were black and Latino because police patrol more heavily in high-crime areas where minorities live.</seg>
<seg id="18">The class-action lawsuit began with four men who sued the department in 2004, saying they were targeted by police because of their race.</seg>
<seg id="19">Scheindlin issued her ruling after a 10-week bench trial that included 11 people testifying they had been unfairly stopped.</seg>
<seg id="20">Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg had blasted her ruling at the time, saying, "This is a very dangerous decision made by a judge who I don't think understands how policing works."</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Michael Cardozo, general counsel for the city, issued a statement saying, "In short, the ruling of unconstitutional practices is no longer operative, and that question will now receive a fresh and independent look both by the appeals court and then, if necessary, by a different trial court judge."</seg>
<seg id="22">In her 198-page August ruling, Scheindlin said that New York's highest officials "willfully ignored overwhelming proof that the policy of targeting 'the right people' is racially discriminatory and therefore violates the United States Constitution."</seg>
<seg id="23">She ordered the Police Department to explore the use of body-worn cameras to document stop-and-frisks, and called for an independent monitor to ensure that the NYPD carried out stop-and-frisks in accordance with the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="24">Scheindlin has long been the judge on cases related to racial profiling because of something called the "related-case rule," which sends all "related" cases to one courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some attorneys have chafed in her courtroom, accusing her of favoring civil rights lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="26">The appeals court indicated that Scheindlin had improperly used the related-case rule to encourage attorneys to file the Floyd case.</seg>
<seg id="27">In footnotes to its decision, the appeals court said that in a December 2007 hearing on a separate case, Scheindlin told attorneys that if they had proof of inappropriate racial profiling, "Why don't you bring a lawsuit?"</seg>
<seg id="28">You can certainly mark it as related.</seg>
<seg id="29">Those lawyers later filed the Floyd case.</seg>
<seg id="30">The appeals court said that "perhaps she gave too bald an indication of her leanings and was thought to have encouraged the lawsuit," said Ian Weinstein, a law professor at Fordham University.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thursday's ruling also cited three articles, by the New York Law Journal, the Associated Press and the New Yorker, as proof that Scheindlin had made improper media appearances by responding to criticism of her rulings.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Center for Constitutional Rights, one of the groups that brought forward the Floyd case, expressed dismay over the appeals court ruling.</seg>
<seg id="33">"That, unprompted, they should reassign the case from a judge deeply steeped in the issues for the last 14 years, who gave the city every opportunity to defend itself in the course of this litigation, is troubling and unprecedented," a statement from the group said.</seg>
<seg id="34">New York City's appeal of Scheindlin's ruling will continue in the 2nd Circuit, with oral arguments beginning sometime after March 14.</seg>
<seg id="35">Should any portion of the case need to be sent back to the District Court, another judge will be assigned.</seg>

<seg id="2">Rabbitohs' Burgess brothers (from left) Luke, Sam and twins George and Tom.</seg>
<seg id="3">Identical 6ft 5in twins, each weighing 120kg, command attention wherever they are.</seg>
<seg id="4">But Tom and George Burgess are enjoying the relative anonymity of being back in England for the Rugby League World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="5">These days the Rabbitohs star are recognised almost everywhere they go in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I'm liking being over here and not having people watching you," said Tom.</seg>
<seg id="7">For Sydney players especially, there's a lot of scrutiny.</seg>
<seg id="8">Because there are four of us and we're English, we're a bit different, a novelty.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sydney has adopted them and mother Julie into its celebrity set.</seg>
<seg id="10">Luke, the oldest and only brother denied an England call-up, has a catwalk model girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sam's girlfriend is an X-factor contestant and Tom is dating Miss Universe Australia, Laura Dundovic.</seg>
<seg id="12">At Salford City Stadium, not too far from Dewsbury Moor where they grew up sons of a labourer and a school teacher, it seems appropriate to reflect.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It's pretty weird to think back to when we were younger, just loving our rugby and imagine we were going to be doing all this," said George.</seg>
<seg id="14">"It's very strange," adds Tom.</seg>
<seg id="15">But it comes from hard work and that's what dad taught us.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is easy to see the impact father Mark had on the 21-year-olds.</seg>
<seg id="17">They were 14 when he died of Motor Neurone disease aged 45.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Dad always brought us up to be close," said Tom.</seg>
<seg id="19">But when he died we took it on ourselves to always look out for each other.</seg>
<seg id="20">We didn't have that father figure there so we became that for each other.</seg>
<seg id="21">We definitely feel like a mutual support system.</seg>
<seg id="22">George interjects: "He was a big strong tough front rower like me and Tom.</seg>
<seg id="23">He was good at instilling great characteristics you need to be a good player - hard work, discipline, not just the skill.</seg>
<seg id="24">He was a good teacher.</seg>
<seg id="25">The twins can only be told apart by George's slightly bent nose and battle scars.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We used to swap places at school when lessons were a bit boring," said Tom.</seg>
<seg id="27">They have not been back since making their debut for the Knights - England's B team - a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="28">"It's been great to be around English teammates again for the World Cup," said Tom.</seg>

<seg id="2">GUNNS' receivers say they have seen "considerable interest" in the failed timber company's remaining assets, including the Tamar Valley pulp mill, as an expressions of interest process begins.</seg>
<seg id="3">KordaMentha announced the EOI process for assets including the pulp mill land and detailed design work, 175,680ha of land and 86,850ha of forest plantations yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="4">"These assets are well positioned to meet growing Asian woodchip and pulp demand," Bryan Webster, of KordaMentha, said.</seg>
<seg id="5">We believe there is significant value in the assets and to date there has been considerable interest.</seg>
<seg id="6">We expect to understand the level of genuine interest in continuing the existing seed-to-port plantation woodchip business and/or the development of the pulp mill opportunity once expressions of interest are received.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr Webster said the plantation and landholding assets divestment was one of the largest of its kind in the world.</seg>
<seg id="8">Industry analysts have been sceptical about the prospects of selling the pulp mill assets, given ongoing community hostility to the project, controversy about it being fast-tracked at state level and doubts about the scale of plantation feed-stock.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, backers of the mill welcomed the expression of interest process, which is due to close by the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">Tasmania's Premier Lara Giddings and the Liberal opposition both expressed support for the project.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gunns went into administration last year after its bankers, led by ANZ, lost patience with its attempts to secure a backer for the mill.</seg>
<seg id="12">"This is a positive step that will help provide certainty to the Tasmanian forest industry and the potential to create new jobs," Ms Giddings said.</seg>

<seg id="13">I think the players have great faith and trust in what we're doing.</seg>
<seg id="14">""I don't think morale's going to be an issue, we've got to make sure we keep the boys ups because it's a very fine line this game."The Kangaroos had 16 more inside 50s than Hawthorn, won the clearances 44 to 25 and the contested possession count by 23.</seg>

<seg id="1">Huawei 'extremely disappointed' with NBN ban</seg>
<seg id="2">Ban upheld: Huawei is still not allowed to participate in Australia's NBN.</seg>
<seg id="3">Photo: Bloomberg</seg>
<seg id="4">Huawei has finally broken its silence after the Coalition government decided to uphold the ban on the Chinese telecom giant participating in the national broadband network, saying the company is ""extremely disappointed"."</seg>
<seg id="5">John Lord, the chairman of Huawei Australia and a former Royal Australian Navy admiral told the company's staff to hold their heads up high and be ""proud to be Huawei"."</seg>
<seg id="6">Mr Lord's letter to staff came after Prime Minister Tony Abbott categorically shut down the speculation that Canberra was going to relax the previous government's ban on Huawei.</seg>
<seg id="7">""While much of this week's commentary has focused on cyber security,"" he said in a letter to all staff.</seg>
<seg id="8">""I want to make it crystal clear that Huawei has never been presented with any evidence that our company or technology poses any kind of security risk.""</seg>
<seg id="9">The former fleet commander played down the importance of the NBN to Huawei's business operation.</seg>
<seg id="10">""Despite the NBN decision, last year was our most successful year to date and today's Huawei's Australian business is bigger than ever.""</seg>
<seg id="11">Huawei Australia more than doubled its revenue in Australia last year and earned $368 million, a 61 per cent increase from the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="12">It has secured major contracts from major telcos including a contract to build part of Optus" superfast 4G network.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr Lord reiterated the company offer to reveal its technology and source codes to be verified by Australian security agencies.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, Huawei's offer has so far been ignored by both the Coalition and Labor governments.</seg>
<seg id="15">""That position still stands--we have nothing to hide, and we have complete confidence in the veracity of our equipment,"" he said, ""we have always understood that the bar is set higher for Huawei and because of that we are willing to go further than any other vendor to prove our security credentials.""</seg>
<seg id="16">He described Canberra's decision to ban Huawei was ""the exception, not the rule.""</seg>

<seg id="1">Ex-Judge to Plead Guilty to Heroin, Gun Charges</seg>
<seg id="2">A former southwestern Illinois judge at the center of a courthouse drug scandal that has resulted in two overturned murder convictions will plead guilty next week to federal heroin and gun charges, his attorney said Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Former St. Clair County Circuit Judge Michael Cook has pleaded not guilty to charges of heroin possession and having a gun while illegally using controlled substances.</seg>
<seg id="4">But a change-of-plea hearing has been scheduled for next Friday in federal court in East St. Louis, Ill., and Cook attorney J. William Lucco said it's Cook's intention to plead guilty to both charges.</seg>
<seg id="5">Lucco had no other comment to the AP.</seg>
<seg id="6">Cook, whose trial has been scheduled for Dec.</seg>
<seg id="7">9, stepped down from the bench in May, five days after being charged in the criminal complaint that accused Cook of being a drug addict.</seg>
<seg id="8">Cook since has sought drug treatment in Minnesota and agreed to have his law license suspended.</seg>
<seg id="9">Cook's legal troubles surfaced after his friend Joe Christ, a former longtime St. Clair County prosecutor and newly sworn-in associate judge, died of a cocaine overdose in March while staying with Cook at his family's western Illinois hunting cabin.</seg>
<seg id="10">Cook, 43, has not been charged in the death of Christ, a 49-year-old father of six.</seg>
<seg id="11">Questions about Cook's drug use have led to overturned convictions in two murder trials over which he presided between Christ's death and the time he was charged.</seg>
<seg id="12">On Wednesday, Circuit Judge Robert Haida - the southwestern Illinois county's former longtime top prosecutor - ordered a new trial for Gregory Muse, who after being convicted in March of first-degree murder alleged that Cook appeared to slur his words while reading the jury instructions before that panel found him guilty.</seg>
<seg id="13">Haida on Oct.</seg>
<seg id="14">2 also granted a new trial to William Cosby, who like Muse complained that prosecutors during his trial wrongly failed to tell defense attorneys that Cook was being investigated, costing them an opportunity to ask for a different judge.</seg>
<seg id="15">Prosecutors in both cases have countered that Cosby and Muse were convicted on the basis of "overwhelming" evidence, and that neither man cited any specific examples of how Cook allegedly botched their trials or showed bias.</seg>
<seg id="16">But Haida ordered both men retried "in the interest of justice."</seg>
<seg id="17">Cook became an associate circuit judge in 2007 and became a circuit judge in 2010.</seg>

<seg id="1">Facebook fesses up: Young teens are getting bored</seg>
<seg id="2">Despite repeated assertions to the contrary, Facebook finally admitted Wednesday that its youngest users really are losing interest in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="3">In its third-quarter earnings call with analysts, CFO David Ebersman addressed the matter of Facebook's teen appeal with the company's most candid admission to date.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Our best analysis on youth engagement in the US reveals that usage of Facebook among US teens overall was stable from Q2 to Q3, but we did see a decrease in daily users, specifically among younger teens," he said.</seg>
<seg id="5">Facebook, Ebersman said, doesn't have an entirely accurate way to measure teen activity as the audience is known to fudge birth dates, but the company has developed internal metrics to look at teen usage.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reveal, which contradicts past statements from CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other executives, confirms the anecdotal: Teens are tiring of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="7">The good news is that Facebook had a stellar third quarter punctuated by an impressive overall engagement rate -- the ratio of daily active users to monthly active users -- of more than 61 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">The company had $2.02 billion in revenue and made 49 percent of its advertising revenue from mobile products.</seg>
<seg id="9">Unfortunately, the disconcerting drop in teens as daily active users, a representation of the group's dip in engagement, has rattled investors who initially drove the company's stock up by as much as 16 percent in after-hours trading.</seg>

<seg id="1">Coen Brothers' Homage to Folk Music</seg>
<seg id="2">"Inside Llewyn Davis" by the Coen brothers, winners of the Grand Prix at the last Cannes Film Festival, is a nostalgic comedy set in Greenwich Village in 1961 and based on folk music, which was just budding there prior to the arrival of Bob Dylan.</seg>
<seg id="3">Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has recently been the subject of a review at the "Cinémathèque française", scooped the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 1991 with Barton Fink.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since they could not hire Dylan or the Peter, Paul and Mary trio, Joel and Ethan Coen opted for a rising American movie star, Oscar Isaac, aged 33, and global pop star Justin Timberlake.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this film bursting with humour, where the music is a central character and the songs are performed live, Oscar Isaac proved himself to be an accomplished folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, abandons pop for folk music with contagious glee.</seg>
<seg id="6">Carey Mulligan, in turn, abandons the wealthy trappings of Daisy Buchanan in "The Great Gatsby" for less glitzy clothes; her singing voice is soft, but her language very coarse when she speaks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells the story of a week of tribulations for a folk singer who has failed to get a break and is angry with the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="8">He reluctantly accepts last minute stand-in roles at studios.</seg>
<seg id="9">With nowhere to live, he sleeps on the couches of friends who will still have him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Documentary-style</seg>
<seg id="11">"His relationship with success is tortured, and that's what interested us: a mix of bad luck and a guy who's never in the right place at the right time, not career-orientated, but honest, with a tendency towards self-destruction," Ethan Coen, who, with his brother Joel, has won several Oscars and Cannes prizes, told the press.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even though Llewyn Davis never existed, the two directors, who are folk music fans, based their story on real people of the time, such as folk musician Dave Van Ronk.</seg>
<seg id="13">The idea was to portray the moment preceding the advent of Greenwich Village, the New York district destined to become "the epicentre of the folk music boom that created international stars", according to the journalist Elijah Wald, a friend of Van Ronk.</seg>
<seg id="14">The film has the feel of a documentary, from the fusty record label overrun with unsold LPs and inhabited by a priceless old secretary, to the musical choices of the studios of the day and the cafés where the singers performed.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Coen brothers' magic continues to work by integrating a comical character who is permanently on screen: a magnificent, cute ginger cat who is Llewyn Davis' companion in fate.</seg>
<seg id="16">Asked how he had developed his character, the actor and singer Justin Timberlake recalled how he "grew up in Tennessee, bathed in the blues and country music".</seg>
<seg id="17">"My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather. He taught me to play the guitar," he added.</seg>
<seg id="18">Timberlake says that although you have to work "to be considered good...luck can also launch your career...more and more so today".</seg>
<seg id="19">Like Llewyn Davis, who refuses to compromise on his music, the pop star says that in a career, "the most important thing is to avoid getting trapped by things that prevent us from expressing ourselves".</seg>

<seg id="10">But mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik apologised to his mother for ruining her life before she died of cancer this year, according to a new biography.</seg>

<seg id="15">Wenche was taken by ambulance to visit her son in jail.</seg>

<seg id="17">Still in handcuffs, he put his arms over and around his mother in a hug.</seg>
<seg id="18">'Sorry that I have ruined your life,' he whispered, the book said.</seg>

<seg id="23">'I hate him,' Wenche Breivik said of her son after days spent recovering from the shock of the killings in a psychiatric hospital, the book says.</seg>
<seg id="24">Afterwards, she felt guilt and feared that she could be killed in a revenge attack.</seg>
<seg id="25">You can never stop loving your child...</seg>
<seg id="26">It's nature,' Christensen said of Wenche Breivik's conflicting emotions.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the book, Breivik's mother once described herself as the world's 'saddest mother' who both hated and loved her son.</seg>
<seg id="28">It also details how his mother had no inkling that he was planning the attacks on July 22, 2011, cooking him a dinner of spaghetti that got cold as she waited in vain for his return and watched the news of bombings and shootings by an unknown killer.</seg>
<seg id="29">Controversy: Author and journalist Marit Christensen, left, wrote Moren (Mother) after spending hours interviewing Anders Breivik's mother, but its contents have provoked anger from the Breivik family</seg>
<seg id="30">She broke down in tears when the police came to her house that night to say Anders Breivik was to blame for the massacre - a bombing in Oslo that killed eight and a shooting rampage on a nearby island that killed 69, many of them teenagers.</seg>
<seg id="31">Wenche Breivik broke off cooperation with Christensen just before her death, saying she did not want the book published.</seg>
<seg id="32">Publishers Aschehoug went ahead, arguing it was in the public interest.</seg>
<seg id="33">Jens Breivik, father of Norwegian mass-murderer Anders Behring Breivik, spoke out today against a book about his late ex-wife in which he is negatively portrayed.</seg>
<seg id="34">He is described in the book as a 'domestic tyrant', according to Norwegian Daily Dagbladet.</seg>
<seg id="35">Speaking to Norwegian radio station P4, Breivik said the description of him in the book was fictional, and stressed that the author did not contact him while she was writing and researching the book.</seg>
<seg id="36">He said: 'It's completely made up.</seg>
<seg id="37">Almost nothing is rooted in reality.</seg>

<seg id="41">The marriage ended when the couple's son was only one year old, and Norwegian social services recommended that the boy be taken into care at the age of four due to his mother's mental health problems.</seg>
<seg id="42">Wenche Behring Breivik was due to speak at her son's trial, but pulled out at the last minute.</seg>

<seg id="46">Breivik, a right-wing anti-Islamic fanatic now aged 34, is serving Norway's maximum sentence in jail for the attacks, which were aimed at the Labour-led government and its youth wing.</seg>
<seg id="47">At the release of her book, Christensen told reporters it was unclear what caused Anders Breivik to become a killer.</seg>
<seg id="48">She said it was probably a blend of factors including genetics, family background, and social and political influences.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pitcairn to Create World's Largest Marine Reserve</seg>
<seg id="2">Pitcairn Island is aiming to create the largest marine reserve in the world, daily newspaper Les Nouvelles de Tahiti announced on Thursday, following up on news from Radio Australia.</seg>
<seg id="3">The island, which lies to the east of the Gambier archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory in the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.</seg>
<seg id="4">The territory measures 47km2, including three other small islands nearby.</seg>
<seg id="5">It has been British since its occupation by the Bounty mutineers, an episode in British maritime history that has been turned into three Hollywood films.</seg>
<seg id="6">Several dozen inhabitants, the majority of them descendants of the Bounty mutineers, still live on Pitcairn, with 95% of their income depending on the generosity of London.</seg>
<seg id="7">The island's Council voted unanimously in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the tiny archipelago. It will be 836,000km2, corresponding to its exclusive economic zone.</seg>
<seg id="8">An assistant to the mayor went to London to ask Great Britain to endorse this request.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mike Warren, the mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected zone would be the first step towards greater financial autonomy for the island.</seg>
<seg id="10">The project will need to be ratified by the British governor of Pitcairn, who is based in New Zealand, and the British government.</seg>
<seg id="11">Creating such a reserve would permit the United Kingdom to protect the 836,000km2, provided it has the means to ensure it is policed - which it does not.</seg>
<seg id="12">There is no airport on Pitcairn, making it impossible to base one or more aircrafts there to monitor the zone, and there is no port where military surveillance crafts can be placed.</seg>
<seg id="13">France, on her part, already has to carry out the highly expensive aerial and maritime surveillance of 5 million km2 of the EEZ of French Polynesia, adjacent to Pitcairn.</seg>

<seg id="1">Long odds for Tom Waterhouse revival</seg>
<seg id="2">Illustration: Rocco Fazzari</seg>
<seg id="3">Read the full story in tomorrow's BusinessDay</seg>
<seg id="4">The telegenic Tom Waterhouse vowed in May we would be seeing less of him following the controversy of his spruiking of live odds across our most popular sports.</seg>
<seg id="5">It now appears he has fresh incentive to do so.</seg>
<seg id="6">Mr Waterhouse may be forced to curb his marketing arsenal due to a more recent vow - to make a profit.</seg>
<seg id="7">This follows the sale of his business in August to UK bookie, William Hill, for a modest $30 million up front with a further $70 million dependent on the company turning a significant profit by the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="8">As many suspected, the massive marketing spend by Tom Waterhouse to date means the business is expected to lose more than $3 million this year on a customer base of 75,000, according to William Hill.</seg>
<seg id="9">It could have been worse.</seg>
<seg id="10">British rival, Bet365, might be rethinking its spend after losing more than $36 million in its first year of operations here, which included a marketing campaign featuring Hollywood star, Samuel L Jackson, a significant factor.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bet365 gained 40,000 customers and revenue of just $7.7 million.</seg>
<seg id="12">For Waterhouse to receive some, or all, of the $70 million rump payment the business needs to generate an operating profit on a sliding scale between $10m and $30m for the year ending December 31, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr Waterhouse said it is still important for the company to market aggressively and get a ""share of voice"" as it looks to entice punters away from TAB outlets to its online betting shop.</seg>
<seg id="14">""While TV works well as a way to advertise we will continue to use it,"" Mr Waterhouse said.</seg>
<seg id="15">But he added: ""I don't know if we will necessarily go as much on TV.""</seg>
<seg id="16">The early signs of retreat are already there to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Waterhouse brand will no longer be plastered all over Nine's NRL coverage from next year with Sportsbet - owned by Irish betting shop, Paddy Power - paying a reported $40 million to replace him as Nine's official partner.</seg>
<seg id="18">Sportsbet would not confirm the deal but said sanity is returning to pricing for sport broadcast sponsorships.</seg>
<seg id="19">""The prices that were being paid were crazy,"" said Sportsbet executive, Barni Evans.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some of the price inflation was driven by hyper competition for a small number of premium assets in the marketplace and Tom Waterhouse was at the centre of that.</seg>

<seg id="1">AFL strongly considering an Anzac Day triple header</seg>
<seg id="2">St Kilda and Sydney players run through a joint banne for the first AFL match outside of Australia for premiership points.</seg>
<seg id="3">THE AFL is strongly considering an Anzac Day triple header next year involving nine hours of football, with Brisbane emerging as St Kilda's likely opponent.</seg>
<seg id="4">Anzac Day falls on a Friday next year, which means the league could conceivably play Collingwood-Essendon at 2pm, St Kilda and a Queensland opponent (5pm) in Wellington and finally the traditional Len Hall clash involving Fremantle at Patersons Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="5">It would be a ratings bonanza, satisfy St Kilda's wish to grow its New Zealand presence and give Fremantle the fixture they require to commemorate Anzac Day in the west.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Saints will discuss their potential opponents for next year with the AFL in coming weeks, but Wellington's Council believes a Queensland team would lure extra visitors from another state to the nation's capital.</seg>
<seg id="7">Brisbane was mentioned in early discussions last year, but either the Lions or Gold Coast would fit the bill perfectly given it is the council which stumps up the backing for the Saints.</seg>
<seg id="8">New South Wales and Queensland are key markets for Wellington, which provides St Kilda between $400,000 and $500,000 per New Zealand game.</seg>
<seg id="9">The league has already all but guaranteed the Saints presence in New Zealand until 2015, with excitement already building about a spectacular Anzac Day commemoration built around the Gallipoli centenary.</seg>
<seg id="10">Wellington will be the centrepiece of New Zealand's Gallipoli centenary in 2015, with buzz centering around a possible harbour re-enactment that could even involve legendary director Peter Jackson.</seg>
<seg id="11">The harbour city will open a National War Memorial Park in time for Anzac Day 2015, with the league keen to be part of the build-up on such an important day for both countries.</seg>
<seg id="12">St Kilda easily met its performance indicators to kick the deal into the next phase with two matches in each of 2013 and 2014, with hotel occupancy alone jumping from 22 per cent last Anzac Day to 100 per cent this week.</seg>
<seg id="13">Saints veteran Nick Dal Santo said yesterday the vibe during the week in Wellington proved the concept was a success.</seg>
<seg id="14">"I think the whole week's been pretty good; the way Wellington and NZ's embraced us, they've got a little bit out of it as well with us being around," he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">It felt a little bit like grand final week, you walk down the street and there's St Kilda scarves, people just walking the streets, St Kilda and Sydney.</seg>
<seg id="16">It just has a really good feel.</seg>
<seg id="17">Obviously it's a huge occasion.</seg>
<seg id="18">I think 22,000, I assume the clubs and Wellington would be happy with that.</seg>
<seg id="19">I can only see it getting bigger though.</seg>
<seg id="20">The spectacle that was put on last night, even though it was a little bit greasy and the game wasn't as clean as it can be, particularly at the dome under the roof, it was a really competitive game.</seg>
<seg id="21">I'd like to think NZ people would have been impressed by the way we play our footy.</seg>

<seg id="2">It seems the nation's oldest and most prestigious department store has been flooded by exuberant Liberal and National voters since September's federal election who are happy to celebrate the conservative election victory with a new suit, dress or bottle of expensive perfume.</seg>
<seg id="3">Upmarket department store David Jones looks is one of the few discretionary retailers to have swollen cash registers in the wake of last month's federal election in the midst of continued gloom elsewhere in the sector with other retailers only experiencing a limited and short-lived bump in sales after the polls.</seg>
<seg id="4">Chief executive Paul Zahra said this morning as he unveiled the department store's first quarter sales result which showed a gain of 2.1 per cent to $424.2 million that September had been a "stand out" month for the business with certainty flowing from the change of government, a higher sharemarket and household budgets in better shape all contributing to improving sales.</seg>
<seg id="5">"September was a stand out, so you can draw that conclusion it was driven by the election, but as most people know 78 per cent of our stores excluding CBD locations sit in coalition seats, so that's got to be favourable to the company," Mr Zahra said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Investors have pounced on the company's stock since the announcement, with shares rising 5.7 per cent to $2.875.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr Zahra said its range of Australian fashion designers were experiencing double-digit sales growth while fashion and beauty as whole had all been stronger during the September quarter.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the lead up to the beginning of the Spring Racing Carnival, which will reach its fashion peak next week with the Melbourne Cup, David Jones had sold 200,000 dresses and plenty of ladies hats.</seg>
<seg id="9">[The election outcome] adds to people's confidence, what we know is general households, their balance sheets are healthy but there is still a little bit of uncertainty as people are waiting to see what any new policies the federal government may announce.</seg>
<seg id="10">""In the meantime of course the change of government I would say has had some positive impact to our customers.""</seg>
<seg id="11">The booming sharemarket, now at a five year high, has also helped David Jones' customers feel more positive about spending at its stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">But Mr Zahra warned there still remained some uncertainty over white-collar jobs with many consumers still cautious.</seg>
<seg id="13">For the meantime however, David Jones September quarter sales were slightly ahead of market and analyst expectations.</seg>
<seg id="14">Like-for-like sales numbers - which excludes the impact of new store openings - were down slightly by 0.3 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="15">David Jones said disruptions caused by the refurbishment of the Canberra Centre store had cost it some sales momentum during the quarter - but excluding these store works, David Jones comparable sales actually rose 0.6 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was some reason for investors to cheer however, with total sales for the September quarter the first positive growth for the department store in three quarters.</seg>
<seg id="17">Total sales in the fourth quarter were down 1.3 per cent, or down 2.9 per cent on a like-for-like basis.</seg>
<seg id="18">Other retailers have not fared so well since the election.</seg>
<seg id="19">Woolworths boss Grant O'Brien yesterday said after he unveiled the supermarket giant's first quarter sales performance that he hadn't witnessed any significant boost to store sales following last month's federal election.</seg>
<seg id="20">Wesfarmers CEO Richard Goyder said spending had dipped in the lead up to polling day on September 7 with a bump in sales soon after but this rebound was only momentary with spending habits returning to pre-election levels.</seg>
<seg id="21">Despite the poor trading conditions still stalking much of the discretionary retail sector, Mr Zahra said the business was well prepared to capitalise on the important Christmas and clearance trading periods through new merchandise partnerships such as with iconic UK brands Harrods and Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="22">""Whilst it is still early days and we have to trade through the important second quarter, it is pleasing to see the company return to positive sales growth this quarter," Mr Zahra said."</seg>
<seg id="23">The department store should also benefit from its poaching of upmarket menswear line Hugo Boss from arch rival Myer which is targeted to reap $100 million a year in sales for the retailer.</seg>
<seg id="24">David Jones new webstore, which turns one year old next week, had increased 10-fold during the quarter and made a positive profit contribution for the year, he said.</seg>
<seg id="25">Across its network of department stores, NSW and Victoria had been the strongest performing areas, with ACT the weakest.</seg>
<seg id="26">David Jones was now preparing for the crucial Christmas and New Year's clearance sales.</seg>
<seg id="27">""Next week to coincide with the launch of our new "WOW" Christmas campaign I will commence a nationwide store review to ensure we are well prepared, across all of our sales channels, for the Christmas and clearance trading periods," Mr Zahra said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snowden May Testify in German NSA Inquiry</seg>
<seg id="2">Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor living under asylum in Russia after leaking details of vast U.S. surveillance activities, may travel to Berlin to testify in an inquiry into revelations of American spying in Germany, though doing so could complicate his refugee status.</seg>
<seg id="3">Snowden met in Moscow on Thursday with veteran German Green Party candidate Hans-Christian Ströbele, who said Snowden indicated he's willing to assist in the German parliament's inquiry.</seg>
<seg id="4">Snowden, who recently took a job with a tech firm in Moscow, could face legal and logistical hurdles in traveling from Russia, where he has been granted asylum status, to Germany, where he has not, though witnesses testifying at German parliament are generally granted the legal protection necessary for them to do so, the Guardian reports.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an interview published Friday by Russia Today, Snowden's attorney said that if he does travel outside of Russia he will lose his refugee status.</seg>
<seg id="6">The lawyer said, however, that Snowden may be able to assist with the German inquiry remotely from Russia.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snowden's trip to Berlin would provide an opportunity for him to re-submit a request for asylum in Germany, which was rejected in June on the technicality that, for his application to be considered, he had to have applied in person on German soil.</seg>
<seg id="8">Snowden's Russian lawyer did not offer confirmation that his client is looking to re-settle in Germany, saying Snowden is settling into Russian life, learning the language, attending events, and working now at a tech firm.</seg>
<seg id="9">During his meeting with Ströbele, Snowden reportedly handed over a letter to be delivered to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, which will be read publicly Friday.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the letter purported to be from Snowden, the leaker writes "my government continues to treat dissent as defection, and seeks to criminalize political speech with felony charges that provide no defense."</seg>
<seg id="11">"However, speaking the truth is not a crime. ... I hope that when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved, I will be able to cooperate in the responsible finding of fact" regarding media reports of NSA surveillance stemming from his leaks.</seg>
<seg id="12">The inquiry into NSA activities in Germany is scheduled to begin in the Bundestag on Nov.</seg>

<seg id="1">AP PHOTOS: India Glitters Ahead of Diwali</seg>
<seg id="2">Millions of Indians stocked up on firecrackers, handed out sweets and adorned their homes with glowing lanterns and sparklers ahead of Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The most important festival of the year in India, Diwali celebrates the triumph of good over evil.</seg>
<seg id="4">The biggest - and loudest - celebrations come Sunday, when people set off a near-constant stream of firecrackers that light up the sky before leaving a dark, smoggy cloud that lingers for days.</seg>
<seg id="5">This year, mindful of the pollution and the dangers of the deafening displays, authorities have made a push to cut down on the number of firecrackers, and some schools sent notices home urging parents not to buy any fireworks.</seg>
<seg id="6">The country's grim financial straits also may affect this year's celebrations.</seg>
<seg id="7">At a wholesale market in New Delhi, shopkeeper Mahesh Chand Sagar said the financial downturn is affecting sales.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Fulfilling one's basic needs has become a problem nowadays," said Sagar, 40, who has been selling candles, garlands and other decorations for the past 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="9">If people can't afford basic necessities, how will they buy decorative items?</seg>
<seg id="10">Typically, people buy gold during Diwali, including jewelry, coins and small statues of the elephant-headed Ganesh.</seg>
<seg id="11">But the government has imposed a steep new tax on gold imports, making the already-high prices far out of reach for many Indians.</seg>
<seg id="12">Still, it seems unlikely the concerns about pollution and finances will dampen enthusiasm for Diwali too much.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the run-up to the festival, people hand out sweets, give their homes a vigorous cleaning and offer prayers to Ganesh and to the Hindu goddess of wealth, Lakshmi.</seg>
<seg id="14">Shops have been packed with customers buying new clothes, gifts for friends and co-workers and brightly lit decorations for their homes.</seg>
<seg id="15">Potters ramp up production of popular earthen lamps, known as diyas.</seg>
<seg id="16">On the night of Diwali, which is a shortened form of the word Deepavali, meaning 'a row of lamps,' families gather for the spectacular fireworks displays held all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">Diwali also is celebrated by Hindus in other parts of the world, including Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Nepal and Malaysia.</seg>

<seg id="1">5 signs the stock market is in a bubble</seg>
<seg id="2">By</seg>
<seg id="3">Constantine von Hoffman /</seg>
<seg id="4">MoneyWatch/ October 31, 2013, 1:56 PM</seg>
<seg id="5">(MoneyWatch) U.S. stock markets have had a good year so far, but has it been too good?</seg>
<seg id="6">The Standard & Poor's 500 is up 24 percent in 2013, after rising 13 percent last year, while the Dow Jones industrial average is up nearly 5 percent since the beginning of May.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some stock watchers think that rise, which extends a bull market that started in 2009, is unwarranted because growth in the U.S. and overseas remains sluggish.</seg>
<seg id="8">The onslaught of headlines focusing on stocks hitting new highs seems to ignore the grimmer realities minimal job growth and eroding consumer confidence.</seg>
<seg id="9">Even the government shutdown didn't slow the party.</seg>
<seg id="10">So are stocks in a bubble?</seg>
<seg id="11">Here are a few things to keep in mind:</seg>
<seg id="12">There's too much money in the system.</seg>
<seg id="13">Larry Fink, CEO of giant money manager BlackRock, clearly thinks the market is frothy.</seg>
<seg id="14">"We've seen real bubble-like markets again," he said at a panel discussion this week, according to the Bloomberg news agency.</seg>
<seg id="15">We've had a huge increase in the equity markets.</seg>
<seg id="16">Fink and many others are concerned about the impact of the Federal Reserve's "quantitative easing" program, under which the central bank is buying $85 billion a month in government bonds and mortgage securities in hopes of stimulating economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="17">These assets have vastly expanded the Fed's balance sheet, including recently.</seg>
<seg id="18">Since Sept.</seg>
<seg id="19">4 alone, those balance sheets have increased 4.3 percent, while the S&P 500 has increased 4.9 percent.</seg>
<seg id="20">In other words, investors are doubling down to capitalize on the cheap money that continues to flood the market.</seg>
<seg id="21">Interest rates have been too low for too long.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Fed's policy of keeping interest rates ultra-low has encouraged some problematic investor behavior.</seg>
<seg id="23">First, it means that traditionally safe investments like U.S. government bonds pay very low interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="24">This makes investors look for better returns in other assets, like the mortgage-backed securities which contributed to the financial crisis five years ago.</seg>
<seg id="25">Today that asset could be stocks, raising the risks that any bubble in equities could suddenly pop.</seg>
<seg id="26">Second, low interest rates make it attractive to borrow money for investment purposes.</seg>
<seg id="27">In September, investors took out a record amount using their brokerage accounts as collateral to get those loans.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to the New York Stock Exchange, investors borrowed more than $401 billion, surpassing April's record of $384 billion.</seg>
<seg id="29">That was a 4.8 percent increase from the previous month, the biggest single-month jump since January.</seg>
<seg id="30">Rising levels of debt are frequently seen as a sign of increasing investor confidence.</seg>
<seg id="31">But it can also be a sign of excessive speculation, especially when that money is re-invested in stocks.</seg>
<seg id="32">Under these conditions, stocks rise mostly because people with borrowed money are buying them, not because of fundamental growth in the economy.</seg>
<seg id="33">Not many people are buying stocks.</seg>
<seg id="34">This may seem counterintuitive to the last point, but it isn't.</seg>
<seg id="35">Since 2009, the volume of shares being traded on the major U.S. stock exchanges has decreased every year.</seg>
<seg id="36">As a result, it doesn't take a lot of activity to move stock prices up.</seg>
<seg id="37">Corporate profits are increasing, but revenues aren't.</seg>
<seg id="38">As of Monday, 49 percent of companies in the S&P 500 had reported results for the third quarter of this year.</seg>
<seg id="39">And according to a report from FactSet, "The percentage of companies reporting earnings above estimates is above the four-year average, while the percentage of companies reporting revenue above estimates is below the four-year average."</seg>
<seg id="40">This suggests earnings are increasing not because companies are growing, but because they are cutting costs and buying back stock.</seg>
<seg id="41">There is a limit to how long they can continue to do this.</seg>
<seg id="42">Copper prices are falling: Historically, the price of copper has followed prices on the key stock exchanges.</seg>
<seg id="43">That's because copper is an industrial metal, and increased demand for the metal means companies are producing and selling more things.</seg>
<seg id="44">That, in turn, tends to boost the value of companies and their stock.</seg>
<seg id="45">Here's the thing.</seg>
<seg id="46">Since 2011, copper prices have steadily dropped even as stocks have continued to climb.</seg>
<seg id="47">The financial markets have long been seen as reflecting future economic activity.</seg>
<seg id="48">In short, if the markets were going up, then the economy was also going up, or would be soon.</seg>
<seg id="49">But it is getting increasingly difficult to make the case that the markets as they are now reflect anything but themselves.</seg>

<seg id="2">ARCHAEOLOGISTS in Greece's second-largest city have uncovered a 70-metre section of an ancient road built by the Romans that was city's main travel artery nearly 2000 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="3">The marble-paved road was unearthed during excavations for Thessaloniki's new subway system, which is due to be completed in four years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The road in the northern port city will be raised to be put on permanent display when the metro opens in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="5">The excavation site was shown to the public today, when details of the permanent display project were also announced.</seg>
<seg id="6">Several of the large marble paving stones were etched with children's board games, while others were marked by horse-drawn cart wheels.</seg>
<seg id="7">Also discovered at the site were remains of tools and lamps, as well as the bases of marble columns.</seg>
<seg id="8">Viki Tzanakouli, an archaeologist working on the project, said the Roman road was about 1800 years old, while remains of an older road built by the ancient Greeks 500 years earlier were found underneath it.</seg>
<seg id="9">"We have found roads on top of each other, revealing the city's history over the centuries," Mr Tzanakouli said.</seg>
<seg id="10">The ancient road, and side roads perpendicular to it appear to closely follow modern roads in the city today.</seg>
<seg id="11">About 7 metres below ground in the center of the city, the ancient road follows in roughly the same direction as the city's modern Egnatia Avenue.</seg>
<seg id="12">The subway works, started in 2006, present a rare opportunity for archaeologists to explore under the densely populated city - but have also caused years of delays for the project.</seg>
<seg id="13">In 2008, workers on the Thessaloniki metro discovered more than 1000 graves, some filled with treasure.</seg>
<seg id="14">The graves were of different shapes and sizes, and some contained jewelry, coins or other pieces of art.</seg>
<seg id="15">A massive excavation project also took place during the 1990s in the capital, Athens, before the city's new metro system opened in 2000.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thessaloniki's new subway is already four years behind schedule, due to the excavation work as well as Greece's financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="17">Thirteen stations will operate initially, before a 10-station extension is added later.</seg>

<seg id="1">Video: Anger as driver eats bowl of cereal</seg>
<seg id="2">A DRIVER has been branded "stupid" after being caught on video in central Edinburgh eating a bowl of cereal while driving to work.</seg>
<seg id="3">The remarkable footage captured on a cyclist's headcam shows the motorist overtaking cyclists at 30mph near the Meadows while apparently trying to use a spoon to eat his breakfast cereal with milk.</seg>
<seg id="4">The rider, who goes by the name of "Raging Bike," can be heard yelling as the grey Vauxhall Corsa whizzes past.</seg>
<seg id="5">The motorist is glimpsed using one hand to hold the bowl and steer the car.</seg>
<seg id="6">Raging Bike then catches up with the driver at a set of traffic lights where the motorist can be seen tilting the bowl to get the last remaining morsels before putting the dish on the passenger seat and taking off.</seg>
<seg id="7">The minute-long video has been posted on YouTube under the title "Breakfast at 35mph . . . look no hands."</seg>
<seg id="8">Kevin Clinton, head of road safety at The Royal Society of the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA), said: "This driver is being irresponsible and risking his own life and the lives of people around him, especially the cyclists he is overtaking."</seg>
<seg id="9">Trying to hold and eat from a bowl while driving is a particularly stupid and dangerous thing to do.</seg>
<seg id="10">Drivers who eat or drink at the wheel can be prosecuted for not being in proper control of a vehicle, or for careless or dangerous driving, and if someone dies they can be charged with causing death by careless or dangerous driving.</seg>
<seg id="11">Motorists caught eating behind the wheel in Scotland can be penalised with a hefty fine of £90 and penalised three points on their licence.</seg>
<seg id="12">Avid cyclist and Green councillor Gavin Corbett urged motorists to hop on a bike at least once to experience the risks posed by irresponsible drivers for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="13">He said: "I'd hope that drivers would pay attention to the road simply because that is what is safe, not because they are being filmed."</seg>
<seg id="14">As a pedestrian, cyclist and occasional driver I see, every single day, examples of drivers treating being behind the wheel as an extension of the office, breakfast table or bedroom - phoning, unwrapping food or checking appearance, with little heed to the fact that they're only inches from collision or tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="15">It's the sheer banality of it that's most striking.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ian Maxwell, from cycling campaign group Spokes, said cyclists who captured illegal behaviour on headcams should avoid on-road confrontations for their own safety and instead send the footage directly to Police Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said: "Whether it's texting or eating breakfast, the message should be it's just not on."</seg>
<seg id="18">You're at the wheel of a piece of machinery that can harm other people.</seg>
<seg id="19">The story comes on the heels of the Edinburgh Evening News coverage of the lethal tram tracks at Haymarket station, where cyclists have regularly been caught in the line and thrown in front of moving traffic.</seg>

<seg id="1">Row Over Closure of Emergency Unit at Hôtel-Dieu</seg>
<seg id="2">In light of the rebellion that has been running for several months involving a section of the staff and several unions, including the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, decided on July 10 to "put back the schedule for implementing the project and, in particular, the date for closing the emergency unit which cannot take place on November 4".</seg>
<seg id="3">This was an official request made so as "not to run any risks when dealing with emergency services in Paris at the start of winter", but also aimed at avoiding to hinder the Socialist Party's campaign a few months before local elections.</seg>
<seg id="4">Despite the minister's instructions, the closure is nevertheless expected to take effect on this date.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the APHP, officials prefer the term "transformation" or "change in continuity" to closure.</seg>
<seg id="6">From November 4, the units of the fire brigade, which accounted for a quarter of the 40,000 cases brought to the emergency unit of the Hôtel-Dieu each year, will all have received instructions to take their about thirty serious cases per day to the emergency units of other hospitals in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="7">November 4 is also the day on which hospital training resumes.</seg>
<seg id="8">At the Hôtel-Dieu, interns specialising in emergencies will make way for five general medicine interns on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="9">The transfer of internal medicine beds is scheduled for some point during the month.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The Hôtel-Dieu emergency service has to close as soon as possible, and for us, that's November 4," Loïc Capron, the chairperson of the medical committee (CME) at the APHP which supports the management project, says straightforwardly.</seg>
<seg id="11">"On November 4, patients will no longer be brought by the fire brigade, there will only be people arriving by their own means," confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, chief medical officer at the new Hôtel-Dieu.</seg>
<seg id="12">"However, we will continue accepting emergency cases," he tempers, emphasising the permanent presence of emergency medical service vehicles on site to move critical cases.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Senior emergency doctors will remain on site," he also assures.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the decision to close the emergency service resides with the regional health agency (ARS).</seg>
<seg id="15">"Things are moving gradually," says Nicolas Péju, spokesman for the ARS, for whom "there will be no change in terms of the service offered", come November 4.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The minister has either lied to us or has been lied to," laments emergency medical officer, Gérald Kierzek.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dismissed from his position as head of emergency services in early July for taking a stand against the reorganisation project, he defines himself as a "whistle-blower" in the face of a "cynical" decision taken by the "technical medical administration body".</seg>
<seg id="18">"They are in the process of abandoning and killing off emergency units that were reformed less than five years ago," he believes.</seg>
<seg id="19">For him, "if the other emergency services in Paris were able to absorb the surplus, there wouldn't be a problem."</seg>
<seg id="20">But they are regularly saturated.</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, there is sometimes a nine hour wait at the emergency unit at Lariboisière.</seg>
<seg id="22">The ARS stresses that thirty patients "despatched" to several locations does not run the risk of becoming an "avalanche" for the other emergency services, where human resources would have been reinforced anyway.</seg>
<seg id="23">The ARS, like the APHP, is defending the "new hospital model" which started being implemented on October 7 and is expected to continue taking 30,000 to 35,000 patients a year.</seg>
<seg id="24">By the end of the year, self-employed GPs are also expected to participate in the implementation of an "ambulatory care service".</seg>
<seg id="25">"Where are we heading if we start asking people to self-diagnose?" asks Gérald Kierzek, for whom "the concept of a non-major emergency" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical step backwards".</seg>
<seg id="26">"The same thing will happen as with level 3 maternity units.</seg>
<seg id="27">People are not stupid, they will go wherever the best care is offered."</seg>
<seg id="28">"If the minister does not take a step by Monday, we will take a different approach," warns Christophe Prudhomme, emergency medical officer and member of the healthcare CGT.</seg>
<seg id="29">"We will have a greater presence in the local election campaigns and we will think about putting up a list."</seg>
<seg id="30">In Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet's team, Vincent Roger, a UMP councillor in Paris and MP of the 4th arrondissement, states clearly that "even if the UMP in Paris supports the continuation of emergency services at Hôtel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if you look at the duties."</seg>
<seg id="31">Ann Hidalgo, the Socialist Party's candidate, repeated on Monday morning on France Inter that she was in favour of a moratorium to prevent the closure on November 4.</seg>
<seg id="32">If it went ahead, she would register her clear disagreement, stresses Bruno Juillard, her spokesman.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Even though the reorganisation of the Hôtel-Dieu has an underlying justification, we cannot let this happen without an acceptable plan for the transfer of patients to other hospitals."</seg>

<seg id="2">1 (UPI) -- A new variant of Northrop Grumman's MQ-8 unmanned helicopter has completed first flight testing to validate its autonomous control systems.</seg>
<seg id="3">The MQ-8C Fire Scout, designed for longer flight endurance and increased payload, flew twice at U.S. Naval Base Ventura in California, the company said -- for 7 minutes and then 9 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="4">"First flight is a critical step in maturing the MQ-8C Fire Scout endurance upgrade before using the system operationally next year," said Capt. Patrick Smith, Fire Scout program manager, Naval Air Systems Command.</seg>
<seg id="5">The systems we've developed to allow Fire Scout to operate from an air-capable ship have already amassed more than 10,000 flight hours with the MQ-8B variant.</seg>
<seg id="6">This system's evolution enhances how unmanned air systems will support maritime commanders.</seg>
<seg id="7">The MQ-8C has a larger airframe than the B variant, additional fuel tanks and an engine upgrade.</seg>
<seg id="8">It will be able to fly for as long as 12 hours or carry as much as 2,600 pounds.</seg>
<seg id="9">The B variant is being used by the Navy from frigates conducting anti-piracy operations and has also been used in Afghanistan for surveillance and targeting support operations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Operating the MQ-8B Fire Scout from Navy ships has proved extremely successful.</seg>
<seg id="11">"During at-sea deployments, operators saw the need for a system that carried the same intelligence-gathering capabilities of the MQ-8B, but fly longer and carry additional payloads," said George Vardoulakis, Northrop Grumman's vice president for medium range tactical systems.</seg>

<seg id="2">Nicholas Hall riding Fawkner crosses the line during Victoria Derby Day 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">Here are some eternal truths about the Melbourne Spring carnival: the weather will be changeable; the Caulfield Cup and the Cox Plate will be labelled "the worst ever"; the Melbourne Cup will be dubbed "the strongest ever."</seg>
<seg id="4">Someone - a trainer, usually, but occasionally an owner and this year a bookie - will call for quotas on the number of foreign runners to be introduced so that the locals get a chance to run for Australian racing's biggest prize.</seg>
<seg id="5">Just as certain is that injury, illness or misfortune will afflict some of the stars and, come the greatest of days, they won't be there.</seg>
<seg id="6">This year the unfortunate Atlantic Jewel missed out on her grand final, the Cox Plate, while long-time Cup favourite Puissance De Lune will be an absentee from the Cup after sustaining an injury in the Moonee Valley feature last weekend.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also another hardy annual that appears at this time of year: the call for the Victoria Derby to be reduced in distance from 2500 to 2000 metres.</seg>
<seg id="8">Australia breeds sprinter-milers is the argument that is usually made.</seg>
<seg id="9">We don't have the horses to run this "extreme" distance.</seg>
<seg id="10">They are only plodders.</seg>
<seg id="11">No one is interested.</seg>
<seg id="12">It rewards mediocrity.</seg>
<seg id="13">We should put our money into races that suit the the majority of our horses.</seg>
<seg id="14">These are other reasons advanced in favour of a change.</seg>
<seg id="15">But, interestingly, it's a cry that has been somewhat muted this time round.</seg>
<seg id="16">Is it because those wishing to tinker with the classic have given up and ceded victory to traditionalists?</seg>
<seg id="17">Is it because they have had a change of heart and accepted that a test of endurance for three-year-olds, even at this early stage of their career, is not such a terrible thing?</seg>
<seg id="18">Let's hope so and that public opinion has taken a turn as punters, the racing public and professionals accept that the industry does have a need to foster young staying talent and encourage the breeding of horses designed to cover distance.</seg>
<seg id="19">Needless to say, I am an unabashed fan of the Derby at 2500 metres.</seg>
<seg id="20">It's the classic trip for a race of this nature, the supreme test of stamina for a horse in the early part of their three-year-old season.</seg>
<seg id="21">It demands strength, stamina, tenacity and a turn of foot at the business end of the race - all the qualities a top-line racehorse is expected to possess.</seg>
<seg id="22">If the race were run over 2000 metres it just wouldn't be a Derby.</seg>
<seg id="23">The French messed with their Derby, the Prix Du Jockey Club, reducing it to 2100 metres in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="24">It's still a top-line race, but it doesn't have the same je ne s'ais quoi.</seg>
<seg id="25">Between 1920 and 2005, nine three-year-olds who had won the Jockey Club went on to win Europe's greatest race, the Prix De L'Arc de Triomphe (first run in 1920).</seg>
<seg id="26">Since the race was shortened, none have.</seg>
<seg id="27">The fact that the Melbourne Cup and almost all major races run at 2200-plus in this country seem to be won by imported horses is having a psychological impact.</seg>
<seg id="28">Perhaps the realisation is growing that, unless Australia nurtures its own staying talent, the Cup will more often be won by a foreign raider or by an owner who can stump up a seven-figure sum to buy a promising stayer and bring it here to be trained by a local handler.</seg>
<seg id="29">Maybe the mood is changing, because last year's Derby, run at a decent pace and turned into a real stamina test by Damien Oliver aboard Fiveandahalfstar, turned out to be such a strong form reference, the Anthony Cummings galloper beating Mark Kavanagh's Super Cool, with Rawnaq, from the David Hayes stable, third.</seg>
<seg id="30">Super Cool came out in the autumn to win the group 1 Australian Cup, beating Fiveandahalfstar and the older gallopers.</seg>
<seg id="31">Cummings' horse then went back to Sydney and beat the older horses in the 2400-metre BMW at group 1 level.</seg>
<seg id="32">Rawnaq ran unplaced in the Zipping Classic two weeks later, and has not been seen since.</seg>
<seg id="33">But Hvasstan, fourth home, won at group 2 level in the autumn (although was subsequently disqualified) and goes round in the group 1 Mackinnon Stakes on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="34">Escado, who ran sixth, came out and won the group 1 SA Derby in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="35">And, of course, the leading three-year-old and last week's Cox Plate favourite It's A Dundeel ran down the track in the Derby but proved his essay over 2500 metres did him no harm by winning three group 1s in the autumn (including the ATC Derby) and then became the only horse to beat Atlantic Jewel, in the Underwood Stakes at Caulfield earlier this spring.</seg>
<seg id="36">A quick glance down the list of Derby winners over the past decade reveals that a lot of classy horses who went on to have a major impact triumphed at Flemington and took no harm from their efforts - like Sangster (who has won at group 1 level since in NZ), Lion Tamer (an Underwood Stakes winner) and Monaco Consul (a Caulfield Cup placegetter).</seg>
<seg id="37">Rebel Raider won at 100-1 in 2008, and proved that was no fluke by backing up six months later in the group 1 SA Derby.</seg>
<seg id="38">Efficient, one of the best stayers seen in the past decade, took out the Derby in 2006 while Elvstroem succeeded in 2003: he subsequently won a Caulfield Cup and triumphed on the world stage in Dubai.</seg>
<seg id="39">So here in Australia let's stick to our tradition and keep the Derby as it is.</seg>
<seg id="40">Let's ignore the French, and shout vive la difference!</seg>

<seg id="1">China plea paper 'to be overhauled'</seg>
<seg id="2">A Chinese newspaper that made a front-page appeal for the release of a reporter accused of defamation is to be overhauled, a press regulator says.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Guangzhou-based New Express made a rare public plea for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.</seg>
<seg id="4">But Mr Chen subsequently admitted on television that he had taken bribes to fabricate stories about a part state-owned company.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now the New Express is to undergo "full rectification," the regulator said.</seg>
<seg id="6">The "rectification" order came from the Guangdong Administration of Press and Publication, Radio, Film and Television.</seg>
<seg id="7">A preliminary investigation showed that Yangcheng Evening News Group's New Express had published several untrue reports about listed company Zoomlion in the period of September 2012 to August 2013.</seg>
<seg id="8">"New Express's editorial management was disordered," the regulator said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="9">It said it had decided to "impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou by revoking his reporter's license."</seg>
<seg id="10">It had also "instructed Yangcheng Evening News Group to undertake a complete rectification of New Express, and recommended they investigate the relevant responsible persons at New Express and immediately revise New Express's leadership team."</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr Chen wrote several articles for the New Express alleging financial irregularities at a construction-equipment company called Zoomlion.</seg>
<seg id="12">After he was detained, his newspaper published two front-page appeals for his release, saying it backed his journalism.</seg>
<seg id="13">But Mr Chen then appeared on state television admitting he had published false stories for money.</seg>
<seg id="14">"In this case I've caused damages to Zoomlion and also the whole news media industry and its ability to earn the public's trust," he told state broadcaster CCTV.</seg>
<seg id="15">I did this mainly because I hankered after money and fame.</seg>
<seg id="16">I've realised my wrongdoing.</seg>
<seg id="17">Following Mr Chen's apology, New Express issued a front-page apology, saying it had failed to properly check his reports.</seg>
<seg id="18">Several high-profile suspects have made televised confessions recently.</seg>
<seg id="19">Experts say confessions are still routinely coerced, despite a change in the law earlier this year banning the authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.</seg>

<seg id="1">Wales to vote on new tax powers in referendum</seg>
<seg id="2">The people of Wales will be offered some control of powers over income tax in a referendum, the Prime Minister has announced.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Prime Minister and his Deputy Nick Clegg said Wales would have the ability to borrow and take control over stamp duty revenues as part of a framework giving more responsibility to Cardiff Bay.</seg>
<seg id="4">Decisions about Wales' future had been taken by Whitehall bureaucrats for too long and Wales had suffered as a result, they added.</seg>
<seg id="5">Speaking at Cardiff Bay, Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg said change would give more responsibility to the Welsh Assembly, to create "a strong Wales inside a strong United Kingdom."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Today we are announcing new powers for the Welsh people and the Welsh government," Mr Cameron told a packed press conference at the Senedd in Cardiff Bay.</seg>
<seg id="7">Power that is about building this country up.</seg>
<seg id="8">Power that's about ensuring what I want and what I know the Deputy Prime Minister wants and the First Minister wants, which is a strong Wales inside a strong United Kingdom.</seg>
<seg id="9">A referendum will allow the Welsh to decide on whether to take up some powers over income tax, as Scotland has under the new measures.</seg>
<seg id="10">Under the Scottish system, due to come into force in April 2016, the UK Treasury will deduct 10p from income tax and give MSPs the power to decide how to raise the shortfall, creating the possibility of lower or higher rates in different parts of the UK.</seg>
<seg id="11">The PM and his Deputy, who met Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones to discuss the new devolution settlement, said borrowing powers would help the Welsh government finance improvements to the M4.</seg>
<seg id="12">"This is like a foot on the windpipe of the Welsh Assembly," Mr Cameron said.</seg>
<seg id="13">We want to encourage the Welsh Assembly government to take action as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="14">The new package builds upon recommendations made by the Silk Commission, which suggested a series of tax and spending powers should be devolved.</seg>
<seg id="15">Promising the "devolution of some finance raising powers" the coalition Government leaders said it would allow Mr Jones' administration to begin work on upgrading the M4 - replacing a "road network from a bygone age."</seg>
<seg id="16">Wales will be given some control over stamp duty "bringing in money that can be spent on big Welsh priorities like much needed affordable homes."</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Clegg added: "This is a milestone in the devolution of power to Wales and a big step forward."</seg>
<seg id="18">This package puts the Welsh people in the driving seat on jobs, transport, infrastructure and housing as well.</seg>
<seg id="19">The referendum on power in income tax is entirely a matter for the Welsh people.</seg>
<seg id="20">I am an advocate on further devolution with what I think has been a very centralised tax system in the UK as well.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Prime Minister said certain parts of the Silk Commission, such as handing air passenger duty to Wales, would not be implemented.</seg>
<seg id="22">Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg also announced that the Nato summit will be held in Wales in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="23">Responding to the announcement, the Party of Wales leader Leanne Wood said:"Plaid Cymru broadly welcomes the announcements made this morning on financial powers for the National Assembly for Wales, albeit we would have preferred them to have gone further."</seg>
<seg id="24">""The Party of Wales has pushed for the implementation of the Silk recommendations from the very beginning, and it is good to see that the UK Government has finally made some progress, even though they have fallen short of the full implementation."</seg>

<seg id="1">The Minister of Defence, Rob Nicholson, insisted that injured soldiers are not summarily discharged from the Canadian Armed Forces and stressed that all soldiers undergo a transition process before their return to civilian life.</seg>
<seg id="2">Attacked by liberals and neo-democrats in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson assured that, prior to their discharge, members of the army underwent a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.</seg>
<seg id="3">"All injured soldiers receive the appropriate care in preparation for their return to civilian life and none has been discharged before being ready," he asserted.</seg>
<seg id="4">The detractors are accusing the government of trying to save money by not allowing injured soldiers - who do not meet the army's rule of "universality of service", which requires that personnel be able to carry out a series of varying tasks - to reach the ten-year period of admissibility required for retirement benefits.</seg>
<seg id="5">They have specifically noted two cases reported in La Presse Canadienne, one involving a soldier discharged last Friday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Lance Corporal David Hawkins, a reservist from London, Ontario, was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and discharged from the army, despite asking to be kept on for another year to receive a fully-indexed pension.</seg>
<seg id="7">His case follows that of Lance Corporal Glen Kirkland, who declared before a parliamentary commission last month that he had been forced to leave before he was ready because he did not meet the rule of universality of service.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr. Hawkins stressed that a soldier could be prepared for his departure, with planning and consultation sessions, but that this was totally different than wanting to leave the army.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I told them I wasn't ready," he said in an interview with La Presse Canadienne on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="10">"For several months, I asked if there was a way that I could stay on, and they said no," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="11">Since the start of major combat in Afghanistan, the army has struggled to determine what latitude it can give to injured soldiers who want to stay in the army but are not capable of combat.</seg>
<seg id="12">Under the current rules, seriously injured soldiers have up to three years to recover.</seg>
<seg id="13">If they do not meet the criteria for overseas deployment, they can be forced to leave the army.</seg>
<seg id="14">The data presented to parliament last year indicates that, of the 1,218 soldiers discharged for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the length of service required to obtain retirement benefits.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Wednesday, the liberal spokesman for former service personnel, Jim Karygiannis, asked for Lance Corporal Hawkins to be reinstated, while the neo-democrat Jack Harris demanded an immediate end to "this shameful practice".</seg>

<seg id="1">Captain Cook puts back trouble behind him</seg>
<seg id="2">England's Jonathon Trott plays a sweep shot during the tour match against Western Australia Chairman's XI in Perth.</seg>
<seg id="3">ENGLAND captain Alastair Cook has overcome back trouble and is on track to return for the next tour game against Australia A, paceman Chris Tremlett says.</seg>
<seg id="4">Cook was forced to miss the current three-day match against the Western Australia Chairman's XI after arriving in Perth with a stiff back following the long flight from London.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Tremlett believes Cook will be ready to play in the four-day game against Australia A, starting in Hobart on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="6">"By all accounts he's feeling a lot better," he said.</seg>
<seg id="7">I think he had a stiff back over the last couple of days.</seg>
<seg id="8">But he's been in the nets and in the gym, and he's been in good spirits in the dressing room.</seg>
<seg id="9">Fast bowler Stuart Broad, star batsman Kevin Pietersen and spinner Graeme Swann were also rested from the game, but are expected to feature in Hobart.</seg>
<seg id="10">During England's 3-1 series win on their last tour of Australia in 2010/11, Cook scored 766 runs at an average of 127.66.</seg>
<seg id="11">Australia, which has lost the past three Ashes series, is fighting to reverse a 3-0 defeat in England earlier this year.</seg>
<seg id="12">The first Test starts in Brisbane on November 21.</seg>
<seg id="13">Meanwhile, England's top-order batsmen did what their bowlers couldn't and played their way into form in the opening match of their Ashes tour against the Western Australia Chairman's XI.</seg>
<seg id="14">At stumps on the second day, England were 2-270 on a lifeless WACA pitch in reply to the home team's 5-451 declared.</seg>
<seg id="15">Jonathan Trott, who survived a confident lbw appeal early in his innings, was on 64, while Ian Bell was unbeaten on 77 as the pair spent valuable time in the middle ahead of the first Ashes Test at the Gabba starting on November 21.</seg>
<seg id="16">Opener Joe Root was the only England batsman who failed to cash in and he became the only player dismissed for under 50 in the three-day match when he was trapped lbw for 36.</seg>
<seg id="17">Fellow opener Michael Carberry made 78 against an impotent bowling attack.</seg>
<seg id="18">Looking in good touch, Bell had been at the crease for 154 minutes and faced 137 balls, hitting 11 fours and two sixes, while Trott had faced 135 balls, spiced with eight boundaries.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bell, in particular, shapes as a key player in the upcoming Test series, after topping the aggregates in the series in England earlier this year, with 562 runs at 62.44.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Bell and Trott took their opportunity to acclimatise to Australians conditions, England's fringe fast bowlers were most disappointing in the Chairman's XI first innings, struggling against a second-string state team.</seg>
<seg id="21">Test hopefuls Steven Finn (1-123), Boyd Rankin (1-92) and Chris Tremlett (0-88) claimed just two wickets between them, with the tourists also putting down three catches.</seg>
<seg id="22">Every WA batsman reached 50 apart from Tom Triffitt, who was unbeaten on 18.</seg>
<seg id="23">Queenslander Chris Lynn top-scored with 104.</seg>

<seg id="1">Shopping While Black - The Washington Post</seg>
<seg id="2">And sometimes it involves being falsely accused or even detained.</seg>
<seg id="3">That's what one young black man, Trayon Christian, said happened to him when he bought a $350 Ferragamo belt at Barneys New York.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 19-year-old college student said he was detained because police officers didn't think he could afford the belt and must have been buying it fraudulently.</seg>
<seg id="5">A similar incident happened to African American actor Ron Brown, who said he was handcuffed while shopping at Macy's and accused of credit card fraud.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was buying his mother a $1,000 watch, he said.</seg>
<seg id="7">Brown, who stars in the HBO series "Treme," has filed a lawsuit against Macy's.</seg>
<seg id="8">Macy's said that no employees were involved in the detention or questioning of Brown and that it was investigating that incident.</seg>
<seg id="9">Kayla Phillips, a 21-year-old black nursing student who purchased a $2,500 Celine purse at Barneys, says she also was questioned about her ability to afford the pricey bag.</seg>
<seg id="10">Phillips told the New York Daily News that she bought the orange suede bag with cash from a tax return.</seg>
<seg id="11">Christian and Phillips have also filed lawsuits.</seg>

<seg id="15">Barneys said it had retained a civil rights expert to help review its procedures.</seg>
<seg id="16">Lee offered his "sincere regret and deepest apologies," the AP reported.</seg>
<seg id="17">In a statement posted to the store's Facebook page, Lee said the company has a "zero tolerance for any form of discrimination" and will undergo a "thorough review of our practices and procedures."</seg>

<seg id="1">Abortion Law in Texas Challenged</seg>
<seg id="2">A federal appeal court in Texas has reintroduced certain restrictions on the right to voluntary termination of pregnancy, which had been blocked by a trial judge this week.</seg>
<seg id="3">The decision means that a legal text adopted in the state in July generally challenging the right to abortion will be able to come into force.</seg>
<seg id="4">The decision by the court of appeal means that doctors who practise abortion will need to have an "admitting privilege" with local hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="5">An admitting privilege is the right of a doctor to admit a patient to a hospital or a medical centre to carry out a diagnosis or a procedure, based on his status as a health care worker at a hospital.</seg>
<seg id="6">Defenders of abortion stress that the content of the law may lead to the immediate closure of a third of clinics in the state, as these clinics have failed to obtain the admitting privilege for their practitioners.</seg>
<seg id="7">In all, nearly 22,000 women will be deprived of access to such establishments.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Monday, the day before the law was due to come into force, a trial judge considered that the provisions pertaining to admitting privileges were unconstitutional.</seg>
<seg id="9">But the Attorney General for Texas, Republican Greg Abbott, who is canvassing for the role of governor, asked the court of appeal to overturn the judgement from the trial court blocking the application of the law.</seg>
<seg id="10">A plenary hearing on the matter is scheduled to take place in January.</seg>

<seg id="1">Who Is the Real Paul Fronczak?</seg>
<seg id="2">After being raised as Paul Fronczak, a 49-year-old Nevada man recently discovered that his entire identity, including his name, birth date and even who his biological parents are, was false.</seg>
<seg id="3">After DNA testing revealed Paul Fronczak is not the baby stolen from a Chicago hospital nearly 50 years ago, Fronczak launched a mission to solve the two mysteries in his life: Who is he and what happened to the real Paul Fronczak.</seg>
<seg id="4">I feel kind of like an imposter because I am still using his birth certificate.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Paul is out there," Fronczak told ABC News' Barbara Walters.</seg>
<seg id="6">I have his birth certificate. ...</seg>
<seg id="7">I want to give it to him, and I want to find mine.</seg>
<seg id="8">Tune into Paul Fronczak's full story on "Stolen at Birth: A 20/20 Investigation" on ABC News' "20/20" on Friday, Nov.</seg>
<seg id="9">1, at 10 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="10">Stolen at Birth</seg>
<seg id="11">The mysterious case of Paul Fronczak began at a Chicago hospital in 1964.</seg>
<seg id="12">On Sunday, April 26, 1964, Dora Fronczak gave birth to a healthy 9-pound boy at Michael Reese Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="13">She and her husband, Chester Fronczak, named the baby Paul Joseph Fronczak.</seg>
<seg id="14">The day after the baby's birth, a woman dressed like a nurse came into Dora Fronczak's room, looked at baby Paul and left without a word.</seg>
<seg id="15">Witnesses said the woman was seen elsewhere in the maternity ward several times that day and the day before.</seg>
<seg id="16">No one questioned her or raised any alarm.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the time, Mary Trenchard Petrie was a 19-year-old student nurse working in the maternity ward, and was with Dora Fronczak the day after her delivery.</seg>
<seg id="18">Petrie said she saw the unknown woman in Fronczak's room.</seg>
<seg id="19">"As I was leaving the room, a woman came into the room," Petrie told Walters.</seg>
<seg id="20">The woman said to her, 'The doctor wants to see your baby,' and she said, 'Okay,' and handed the baby to her.</seg>
<seg id="21">The woman in white was able to whisk baby Paul Fronczak out of the maternity ward, down several flights of stairs and out of the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="22">Petrie said 45 minutes passed before the baby was reported missing.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Apparently she got in a cab and took off," she said.</seg>
<seg id="24">For several hours, authorities frantically searched the hospital for the missing baby.</seg>
<seg id="25">At first, Dora Fronczak was not told that her baby was taken, but eventually, authorities came to the maternity ward to deliver the news.</seg>
<seg id="26">"They told her, 'Mrs. Fronczak, your baby's been taken,'" Petrie recalled.</seg>
<seg id="27">She cried a lot.</seg>
<seg id="28">After learning that his son was stolen, Chester Fronczak appealed to the kidnapper through the press.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I pray that she'll take care of the baby," Chester Fronczak told a reporter in 1964.</seg>
<seg id="30">Return him.</seg>
<seg id="31">Hundreds of Leads</seg>
<seg id="32">During a massive investigation, Chicago police and the FBI distributed sketches and a description of the suspected kidnapper, who was described by witnesses as a woman around 35 to 45 years old, dressed in white like a nurse, but without the nurse's cap, and about 5-foot-4 with brown eyes and salt and pepper hair.</seg>
<seg id="33">Police pursued hundreds of leads, including a woman who called to say she knew who took the baby.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Bizarrely, she turns out to be the wife of an alleged drug kingpin who was apparently upset because her adopted child had been removed from her home by authorities," said Brad Garrett, ABC News contributor and former FBI profiler.</seg>
<seg id="35">But she actually didn't know anything about the Fronczak case.</seg>
<seg id="36">RELATED: Paul Fronczak: FBI Working 'Solid New Leads' in Stolen Baby Case</seg>
<seg id="37">At the end of October 1964, Dora Fronczak received a phone call.</seg>
<seg id="38">The person on the other line said they would return the baby if the Fronczaks paid a $10,000 ransom.</seg>
<seg id="39">Police set up a sting with a bag stuffed with cut-up newspaper to resemble the money to capture the suspect.</seg>
<seg id="40">"But it was a hoax," Garrett said.</seg>
<seg id="41">They never had the Fronczak baby.</seg>
<seg id="42">Months after Paul Fronczak was stolen, the nationwide search and relentless police investigation had come up with nothing.</seg>
<seg id="43">A Little Boy Appears</seg>
<seg id="44">Fourteen months after the kidnapping, a little boy, who was approximately 15 months old, was found abandoned in a busy shopping area 800 miles away from Chicago, in Newark, N.J.</seg>
<seg id="45">Initially referred to as "Unknown Male Number One," the child was later placed with a foster family and named Scott McKinley.</seg>
<seg id="46">New Jersey authorities notified the FBI about the abandoned young boy.</seg>
<seg id="47">The FBI asked for pictures of the boy's ears to compare with a picture of Paul Fronczak, who was photographed with only his left ear visible in the hospital after he was born.</seg>
<seg id="48">At the time, the shape of an infant's ear was thought to be as unique as a fingerprint.</seg>
<seg id="49">"The FBI contacted my parents and said, 'We think we foundâ€¦your son,' so my parents had to drive to New Jersey," Paul Fronczak said.</seg>
<seg id="50">According to adoption files obtained by ABC News in the course of the 20/20 investigation, the Fronczaks believed the abandoned boy was baby Paul, but blood tests "were contradictory" and tests did not prove or disprove the boy was their son, so the Fronczaks were legally required to adopt him.</seg>
<seg id="51">In June 1966, two years after baby Paul Fronczak was stolen, the couple took the boy home to Chicago, where they raised him as their own, thinking their nightmare was over.</seg>
<seg id="52">"They brought me back and got me baptized immediately," Fronczak said.</seg>
<seg id="53">The search for the origin of the abandoned child found in New Jersey ended and the Paul Fronczak case was closed.</seg>
<seg id="54">A New Quest for Answers</seg>
<seg id="55">Paul Fronczak was unaware of his kidnapping until he was 10 years old.</seg>
<seg id="56">"I was looking for Christmas presents and snooping around the house, and I found all these boxes," Fronczak said.</seg>
<seg id="57">It turned out it was a box of clippings and a bunch of cards and letters all about a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="58">When he asked his parents about what he found, Fronczak said they said, "Well, you were kidnapped."</seg>
<seg id="59">We found you.</seg>
<seg id="60">The discovery of his kidnapping became a big part of Fronczak's life and left him constantly wondering who he was.</seg>
<seg id="61">RELATED: Barbara Walters: Meet a Man Obsessed with Finding Who He Really Is</seg>
<seg id="62">But last year, Fronczak purchased an in-home DNA test at a CVS drugstore and while his parents were visiting convinced them to take the test.</seg>
<seg id="63">"It's something I wanted to do for a long time, but I never really had the nerve to ... ask my parents," Fronczak said.</seg>
<seg id="64">When he received the DNA test results, Fronczak discovered that there was no remote possibility that he was the real Paul Fronczak.</seg>
<seg id="65">"I don't know anything about myself," Fronczak said.</seg>
<seg id="66">I don't know how old I am, my heritage, my birthday ... all these things that people take for granted.</seg>
<seg id="67">Since finding out he was not the real Paul Fronczak, he admitted he has become obsessed with searching for the real Fronczak and finding clues about his own real identity.</seg>
<seg id="68">The FBI has also re-opened the case.</seg>
<seg id="69">"My main goal for this whole project is to find the real Paul," Fronczak said.</seg>
<seg id="70">My parents raised me, and they did a great job.</seg>
<seg id="71">I feel that if I don't do everything I can to help find the real child, then I'm not doing my job as a son.</seg>

<seg id="1">World Squash 2013: Nick Matthew ousts Egypt's Amr Shabana to set up thrilling semi-final with Ramy Ashour</seg>
<seg id="2">The Yorkshireman mustered an array of tight, angled winners, the Egyptian racking up an uncharacteristic number of tins.</seg>
<seg id="3">Matthew didn't over-complicate matters and, again, he put this down to his off-court work.</seg>
<seg id="4">One sentence emails to his psychologist Mark Bawden, currently working in Australia with the England cricket team, have played their part.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Mark said "your strengths are there, use them,"" Matthew said of the pair's correspondence.</seg>
<seg id="6">They don't clutter your mind, they are simple thoughts and you need those against Ramy [Ashour], who can beat you very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="7">Ashour largely did that to India's Saurav Ghosal, but the surprise quarter-finalist made him work in the first and third games.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Egyptian did seem to be rushing his shots and Ghosal's wrists were accumulating points.</seg>
<seg id="9">By the end of the second, though, Ashour was enjoying it and was even helping the on-court cleaners wipe away the sweat from one of his dives.</seg>
<seg id="10">His manic mindset was made plain after his straight-games win.</seg>
<seg id="11">Backed into a corner by the media, there was no way out for the Egyptian, who usually legs it from the venue.</seg>
<seg id="12">This time he had due cause, after a morning scan on his right leg.</seg>
<seg id="13">With 48 hours rest for Ashour and Matthew - James Willstrop and Daryl Selby play their quarter-finals on Friday night - the world No 1 Egyptian just wants to "feel right."</seg>
<seg id="14">"It goes in his favour as well," Ashour said of their day off.</seg>
<seg id="15">It will be a real match and this can only be better for both us.</seg>
<seg id="16">Whoever wins, it will be certain.</seg>
<seg id="17">Ashour, the defending champion, may be favourite, but with Matthew on home soil, nothing will be certain.</seg>

<seg id="1">Former Hostage in Lebanon Says "Coming Back is Difficult to Handle"</seg>
<seg id="2">Journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was kidnapped on 08 March 1986, along with three members of his Antenne 2 team who had come to film a Hezbollah demonstration, and was set free almost 21 months later, on 27 November 1987.</seg>
<seg id="3">He retired in 2008, but in 2004 he helped set up a hostage defence association, "Otages du Monde" ("Hostages of the World"), which he has been running for several years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The main objective of the association is to make it possible for hostages to press charges and bring their kidnappers before the International Criminal Court.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four AQMI (Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb) hostages, Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Feret, were freed on Tuesday after being held for over 1,000 days.</seg>
<seg id="6">Following medical examinations at the military hospital in Val-de-Grâce on Wednesday afternoon, they have now been reunited with their families.</seg>
<seg id="7">Now they can gradually try to resume their lives.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Le Nouvel Observateur" interviewed 62-year-old Jean-Louis Normandin, a former senior reporter who retired in 2008 and is president of the association "Otages du Monde".</seg>
<seg id="9">On the evening you were set free, you appeared on the mid-evening news on Antenne 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">What are your memories of being set free today?</seg>
<seg id="11">On the ground specifically, in Beirut?</seg>
<seg id="12">The day I was set free, I was in the boot of a car where I met Roger Auque - although I couldn't see him as it was dark.</seg>
<seg id="13">He said "We're free," but I wasn't sure and thought we might still be killed.</seg>
<seg id="14">We were very excited, but also very tense.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was in the middle of a war and the people driving us too were very tense.</seg>
<seg id="16">They dropped us off on a pavement.</seg>
<seg id="17">There were Syrian soldiers there.</seg>
<seg id="18">We were then taken to the Hotel Summerland where the press had gathered.</seg>
<seg id="19">Some Frenchmen took us to the French Embassy.</seg>
<seg id="20">That was when I made my first call to my parents, my family, my friends, the press and so on.</seg>
<seg id="21">I remember taking a one-hour bath,</seg>
<seg id="22">and having dinner in a T-shirt at the French Embassy.</seg>
<seg id="23">I also remember a short night spent talking to Roger and Marchiani.</seg>
<seg id="24">It was still tense as there was no way of evacuating us to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.</seg>
<seg id="25">We got there by helicopter and took a private plane to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua got on board.</seg>
<seg id="26">How were you received when you got to French soil?</seg>
<seg id="27">We landed at Orly.</seg>
<seg id="28">Chirac, the Prime Minister, was there.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was a bit rough,</seg>
<seg id="30">the jostling was unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="31">And there was a lot of media.</seg>
<seg id="32">When I left the country, there were three television channels -</seg>
<seg id="33">when I got back there were loads of them.</seg>
<seg id="34">Coming down the steps of the aeroplane, being reunited with my son and parents, my friends, that was all very emotional.</seg>
<seg id="35">Numerous motorbikes followed our car, which was driven by Roussin, from the airport to my home.</seg>
<seg id="36">The bikes were jostling to get in front and take photos. They followed me all the way home, where I had to do some policing to stop some of them climbing up.</seg>
<seg id="37">The media pressure was huge.</seg>
<seg id="38">It wouldn't stop and we were well placed to know that...</seg>
<seg id="39">Yet, the level of emotion and fatigue made it difficult to think clearly.</seg>
<seg id="40">You come out of a hole and are suddenly in the spotlight of the media.</seg>
<seg id="41">It's a bit complicated, a bit of a shock, quite difficult to handle.</seg>
<seg id="42">But we'd been through the hardest part.</seg>
<seg id="43">I was on the mid-evening news that same evening, and on TV the following day as well.</seg>
<seg id="44">Then a very gentle sort of readjustment to life started, lasting one or two months that were a bit like a holiday.</seg>
<seg id="45">How did the medical examinations and the debriefing with the DGSE (Directorate General for External Security) go?</seg>
<seg id="46">I had to undergo an initial medical check in Corsica.</seg>
<seg id="47">The other tests were carried out in Val-de-Grâce in the days after my return: X-rays, examinations of every type, and an appointment with a psychiatrist.</seg>
<seg id="48">Everything can't be sorted out in one appointment, but you know you can count on the psychiatrist, call on him if needed, that you have not been abandoned to yourself.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is all part of the process.</seg>
<seg id="50">I also met with the intelligence services.</seg>
<seg id="51">They asked me a lot of questions about the hostage-takers.</seg>
<seg id="52">It was normal.</seg>
<seg id="53">It didn't bother me.</seg>
<seg id="54">How do you react today to the liberation of the four hostages in Niger?</seg>
<seg id="55">I'm listening to what's being said.</seg>
<seg id="56">Especially the debate about ransoms.</seg>
<seg id="57">Some things annoy me, others less so.</seg>
<seg id="58">I try to distinguish between the questions about my past as a hostage and my role as president of the association "Otages du Monde", which enables me to keep a distance and seems to me more interesting to deal with.</seg>
<seg id="59">For example, I think about the definition of resilience.</seg>
<seg id="60">And, I fight, alongside other people, for the recognition of the legal status of hostages.</seg>
<seg id="61">I think there is a problem of semantics.</seg>
<seg id="62">We need to qualify hostage-taking as "political" hostage-taking - that's what it is for the most part - and enable the hostages to have access to justice, to press charges and to bring their kidnappers before the International Criminal Court.</seg>
<seg id="63">Today, once again, everyone is wrapped up in compassion, emotion and is rejoicing that the hostages are free.</seg>
<seg id="64">But who is saying that the hostages may also have access to justice?</seg>
<seg id="65">The court in The Hague has been set up for that purpose.</seg>
<seg id="66">Why should we not say to the hostage-takers: "You have flouted the rules of war and those of all the Geneva Conventions, we're going to bring you to justice"?</seg>
<seg id="67">I think that is justified, legitimate, plain common sense.</seg>
<seg id="68">People hear the message, but do not listen, and that shocks me.</seg>
<seg id="69">That's my main struggle.</seg>

<seg id="1">Former St Kilda coach Ross Lyon's 'bizarre' final hurrah</seg>
<seg id="2">Former St Kilda coach Ross Lyon leads the Saints off the ground after the 2011 elimination final.</seg>
<seg id="3">Picture: Michael Dodge Source: Herald Sun</seg>
<seg id="4">A NEW book to mark the St Kilda Football Club's 140th anniversary reveals the depth of bitterness at coach Ross Lyon's controversial departure at the end of 2011.</seg>
<seg id="5">In Strength Through Loyalty, to be launched at a club function on Saturday, St Kilda chief executive Michael Nettlefold talks of Lyon's "bizarre" and "unusual" behaviour late in that season, and says the coach ultimately headed to Fremantle for "purely commercial" reasons.</seg>
<seg id="6">Nettlefold said he sensed there was a problem because Lyon's "behaviour had been quite unusual" over the final months of the 2011 season, culminating in a "bizarre night" when the Saints lost an elimination final to Sydney.</seg>
<seg id="7">Within 30 minutes of the final siren at Etihad Stadium, Lyon had announced the unexpected retirements of Steven Baker and Robert Eddy as well as ruckman Michael Gardiner.</seg>
<seg id="8">Nettlefold said in the ensuing days the Saints believed they had resolved several months of contract talks with Lyon's management group, Elite Sport Properties, and had scheduled a media conference for that Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="9">The date was then pushed back, and during a board meeting on the Thursday evening Nettlefold had to excuse himself from the room to take a call from Lyon, who informed him he was quitting.</seg>
<seg id="10">Nettlefold said he then phoned ESP's Craig Kelly, who confirmed Lyon and his lawyer had independently negotiated a move to Fremantle.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I was stunned by the fact it was done outside the management group ... the fact it was done externally - that was the shock to me," Nettlefold said.</seg>
<seg id="12">We had an agreement with his management group.</seg>
<seg id="13">ESP dropped Lyon as a client and the coach has since said he handled negotiations in a way that would avoid "a clear conflict of interest" because Kelly was managing then Dockers coach Mark Harvey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lyon has asserted St Kilda was lukewarm in its approach to contract negotiations late in the season.</seg>
<seg id="15">Nettlefold disagreed: "At the time it was convenient for that to be used as a reason, but as the situation unfolded and, by Ross's own acknowledgment, it was financially driven," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Nettlefold suggested Lyon was torn on how to "trade out" his strong allegiance to the players and the club for a decision made "purely on a commercial basis."</seg>
<seg id="17">Among the book's other revelations about St Kilda's coaches:</seg>
<seg id="18">LYON'S candidature was put forward by former player and coach Ken Sheldon, not former Fitzroy coach Robert Walls, as has long been suspected.</seg>
<seg id="19">LYON developed his team-defence game plan in closed training sessions during the 2009 pre-season, dividing Moorabbin Oval into marked zones the players were designated to mind.</seg>
<seg id="20">FORMER assistant coach Matt Rendell says board member Grant Thomas was the driving force behind Malcolm Blight's appointment in 2001, inviting him to join the selection sub-committee so he could "woo him" for the senior role.</seg>
<seg id="21">RENDELL said suggestions Thomas wanted subsequently to replace Blight were "crap," and that he was the one man who voted to retain Blight until at least the end of 2011.</seg>
<seg id="22">The book also reveals Thomas was sacked at the end of the 2006 season after a board meeting that went until 3am.</seg>
<seg id="23">The suggestion was Thomas was seeking to take control of the club, not just the football department.</seg>
<seg id="24">There was also a widening rift between the club's board and the football department.</seg>
<seg id="25">Or, as then president Rod Butterss put it, the club had split into "them and us" camps.</seg>
<seg id="26">Butterss said that even during the season two directors "wanted to sack (Thomas), even if he won the premiership."</seg>
<seg id="27">One symptom of the rift came when Thomas organised an overseas training camp without telling the board or including it in the budget.</seg>
<seg id="28">"I read it in the newspaper," Butterss said.</seg>
<seg id="29">The tickets had been bought.</seg>
<seg id="30">Butterss also said he believed Thomas's strong bond with the young playing group "bordered on unhealthy."</seg>

<seg id="2">31, 2013 /PRNewswire/ --</seg>
<seg id="3">31, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Over the summer, Harbor Freight Tools' payment processing system was illegally attacked by cyber-criminals.</seg>
<seg id="4">The attack was similar to attacks reported by other national retailers.</seg>
<seg id="5">In response, we immediately engaged a leading cyber-security company to investigate and notices were posted in every store and on our website.</seg>
<seg id="6">We blocked the attack and adopted enhanced security measures to make our systems more secure than ever.</seg>
<seg id="7">Fortunately, this incident was limited to credit and debit card transactions made in our stores during a relatively short seven week period (May 6, 2013 to June 30, 2013).</seg>
<seg id="8">Transactions after June 30, 2013 were not affected.</seg>
<seg id="9">For nearly all of these transactions, we believe that the attacker only found "track 2" data - information on the card's magnetic stripe that contains only the card account number, expiration date, and card verification number.</seg>
<seg id="10">For less than 1% of these transactions, the attacker may have found data that also included the cardholder's name.</seg>
<seg id="11">Because we cannot identify which specific cards or information were actually taken, we are notifying our customers whose cards were used during the May 6, 2013 to June 30, 2013 time frame at each impacted store.</seg>
<seg id="12">For most of those purchases, we do not have sufficient information to identify the name or address of the customer.</seg>
<seg id="13">For those customers that we have addresses for, we began mailing letters to them on October 31.</seg>
<seg id="14">If you used your card in one of our stores during the seven week period and did not receive a letter, you should review the additional information on ways to protect yourself at www.harborfreight.com/protectingcustomers.</seg>

<seg id="11">Women don't have to be sexy professionals anymore; they can also be sexy foods like pizza, hamburgers and carrots.</seg>
<seg id="12">As for men, I expect we will be seeing a lot of zombies, thanks to The Walking Dead and I'll bet the Daft Punk space men will make it into our Instagram feeds this year.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to Google, the highest searched costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.</seg>
<seg id="14">I guess there's nothing wrong with going traditional.</seg>
<seg id="15">We dressed our dogs up last year and to my amazement we were not alone.</seg>
<seg id="16">In fact, Americans will spend $330 million on pet costumes this year, according to the NRF.</seg>
<seg id="17">That's a lot of ironic hotdog dogs.</seg>
<seg id="18">When it comes to candy, we don't screw around.</seg>
<seg id="19">Americans will spend $1.9 billion on it this year, according to The Nielsen Company.</seg>
<seg id="20">That's around 600 million pounds worth of Hershey bars, lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark Bars.</seg>
<seg id="21">That's great news for the 41 million trick-or-treaters set to take over our neighborhoods, according to the U.S. Commerce Department.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, we will buy and, who are we kidding, consume 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.</seg>
<seg id="23">The one thing we don't want to consume, candy corn; and yet nearly 35 million pounds of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.</seg>
<seg id="24">That's about 9 billion individual kernels of corn.</seg>
<seg id="25">It's a mystery I have yet to solve.</seg>
<seg id="26">Nothing is more quintessentially Halloween than haunted houses.</seg>
<seg id="27">They have the best names, like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which, by the way is in an actual prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock."</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, there are 1,200 officially sanctioned haunted houses in the United States generating about $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes those awesome photos of you mid-peeing your pants that your friend puts on Facebook and you can't take down and then that guy you like sees the photo and leaves a comment like "nice face."</seg>
<seg id="29">Finally, let's talk pumpkins.</seg>
<seg id="30">Charlie Brown introduced us to The Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a jack-o-lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree - it's something we've done since we were little.</seg>
<seg id="31">Lucky for us, the "baby in a pumpkin trend" started only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving these gourds not sitting in them.</seg>
<seg id="32">This year, Americans will spend around $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.</seg>
<seg id="33">The jack-o-lantern slowly withering on your front porch probably came from Illinois, which grew 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you're looking for extra credit, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, Calif., and try to carve up their 2,032 pound pumpkin.</seg>

<seg id="1">Aubervilliers Resident Launches "Parti de la Banlieue"</seg>
<seg id="2">Make no mistake,</seg>
<seg id="3">in the mind of its founder, Abdel-Malik Djermoune, the "Parti de la Banlieue" does not only target suburban residents.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I chose a map of France as the logo," he asserts.</seg>
<seg id="5">"When I talk about suburbs, I'm referring to all those who feel excluded from the larger national family."</seg>
<seg id="6">Be that as it may, his project, which was presented during a press conference in his home town of Aubervilliers on Thursday, was born from a desire to better defend multiculturalism - the great cultural melting pot that, above everything else, characterises these districts.</seg>
<seg id="7">"My primary proposal is to create a Ministry of Multiculturalism," he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">Abdel-Malik Djermoune, a 50-year-old regional attaché, today claims to be "100% apolitical", although he has not always been neutral.</seg>
<seg id="9">An activist supporter of Jean-Pierre Chevénement in 2002, he later supported Dominique de Villepin in the district from 2010 to 2011.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I know that the values of equality that I advocate in my manifesto are associated with the Left, but if people on the Right are prepared to support me, I will listen to them too," he continues.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It is only extremist parties that I will not talk to."</seg>
<seg id="12">Besides multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built his manifesto - which can be read on the Internet - around various subjects intended to appeal to suburban residents, especially the young: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalisation of cannabis, lowering the voting age to 16, restoration of the function of caretaker, etc.</seg>
<seg id="13">He still needs to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas in the political arena. "It is likely that may be done just in time for the 2014 municipal elections," he acknowledges.</seg>
<seg id="14">"The problem is time and money.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, the 'Parti de la Banlieue' should at least be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and in other towns too I hope," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="16">Abdel-Malik Djermoune claims there are already seven names on the candidate list in mainland France and in Martinique.</seg>
<seg id="17">"And the mail expressing support that I have been receiving since yesterday are not all coming from the suburbs," he says with delight.</seg>

<seg id="1">Role reversal: Men model on Ducati motorcycle</seg>
<seg id="2">Photo set of men posing on a Ducati motorcycle goes viral</seg>
<seg id="3">To some, the images are a welcome departure from the "girl on bike" trope</seg>
<seg id="4">Images created partly in response to negative reaction to images of female models</seg>
<seg id="5">(CNN) -- The "girl on bike" is a familiar trope in the motorcycle world, which is why the editor of American motorcycle blog Asphalt & Rubber didn't pay much attention last year when images surfaced of a woman draped across the latest Ducati.</seg>
<seg id="6">But when the dealership responsible for the sexy images re-created them using men -- all bulging muscles and body hair, farmers' tans and booty shorts -- they caught his attention.</seg>
<seg id="7">These were the images he wanted to talk about.</seg>
<seg id="8">The conversation I really wanted to have is if you can put a girl on a bike, you should put a guy on a bike.</seg>
<seg id="9">"And, if that looks silly to you, (then) you should rethink the other," said Jensen Beeler, editor of Asphalt & Rubber.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I'm kind of tired of the 'pinup girl on motorcycle' theme that our industry does, so it was kind of fun to see someone poke that in the eye," Beeler said.</seg>
<seg id="11">I thought to myself, these are guys with a good sense of humor.</seg>
<seg id="12">They're not afraid of pushing boundaries, which is what motorcycles are all about.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the images didn't go beyond the motorcycle world until just last month when they became a viral sensation.</seg>
<seg id="14">You probably saw them on Facebook or Twitter or on one of numerous news websites that showed them off.</seg>
<seg id="15">The overwhelmingly enthusiastic response was far different from the one Beeler got on Asphalt & Rubber in August 2012 when reactions ranged from, "It's nice to see it go the other way for once," to "Why oh why!!!!!"</seg>
<seg id="16">Really??????</seg>
<seg id="17">Or, as one American motorcycle PR firm said, "Half of this made us throw up in our mouth a little bit."</seg>
<seg id="18">But where did the photos come from, and why did they surface again now?</seg>
<seg id="19">Both sets of images were the brainchild of Arun Sharma, general manager of MotoCorsa, a Ducati dealership in Portland, Oregon.</seg>
<seg id="20">Last year, he wanted his shop to be the first to circulate promotional images of the hotly anticipated Ducati 1199 Panigale.</seg>
<seg id="21">He wanted them to be sexy but tasteful, so fans wouldn't have reservations about using them as wallpaper on their office computer.</seg>
<seg id="22">"It's not a big secret that beautiful women and motorcycles go together, but we're not into G-strings," Sharma said in a phone interview.</seg>
<seg id="23">There are smarter ways to go about it.</seg>
<seg id="24">Photographer and "Moto Lady" blogger Alicia Mariah Elfving helped style and shoot the images of the female model.</seg>
<seg id="25">She also wanted to distinguish them from the "pervy images" that have defined motorcycle marketing; she prefers to see women riding bikes rather than hanging off them, she said.</seg>
<seg id="26">But as long as women were modeling, "we wanted to do something that was classy and better looking, so the content would be accessible to a wider audience."</seg>
<seg id="27">They shot the photos the same day the Panigale arrived in the shop.</seg>
<seg id="28">Sharma said he achieved his goal of being the first dealership to circulate images of the hottest bike on the market, bearing MotoCorsa's name and logo.</seg>
<seg id="29">As they spread throughout the world, much of the response was positive.</seg>
<seg id="30">There was some backlash, too.</seg>
<seg id="31">Tasteful or not, some said it was just another set of images of a model draped on a bike.</seg>
<seg id="32">Inspiration struck Sharma a few weeks later, he said, in one those "You know what we should totally do?" moments: "We should totally do the same poses with the guys in the shop."</seg>
<seg id="33">As Elfving remembers it, they had talked about the idea of responding to the backlash by reversing the gender of the models.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Most people loved it, but others were like, 'Oh, a chick on a bike,' " she said in a phone interview.</seg>
<seg id="35">OK, we'll give you something different then.</seg>
<seg id="36">Sharma called a meeting and announced the plan to reshoot the images using MotoCorsa employees.</seg>
<seg id="37">A few refused to take part, he recalls, but most were enthusiastic.</seg>
<seg id="38">They drew numbers to choose who would pose for each shot.</seg>
<seg id="39">Senior technician A.J. Ralston was one of the last to choose.</seg>
<seg id="40">He is pictured precariously perched on all fours on the bike's seat.</seg>
<seg id="41">"I thought it was a fantastic, hilarious idea," said Ralston, who has worked in the shop for 11 years.</seg>
<seg id="42">It seems like we always get a lot of flak from customers whenever we put something up on our Facebook page that has a beautiful woman on a motorcycle, so making light of all of that and having a good time doing it seemed like a good idea.</seg>
<seg id="43">Holding the pose proved to be a challenge for the 5-foot-10-inch, 230-pound technician, especially in slingback shoes and booty shorts.</seg>
<seg id="44">"It was that kind of day, when it was super-hot outside, so holding a pose like that with sweat everywhere and my knees slipping all over the place gave me a new appreciation for what models do," he said.</seg>
<seg id="45">Both versions of the images remained popular within the motorcycle community, sparking a few copycat male pinup shoots.</seg>
<seg id="46">It's not entirely clear why the images resurfaced again recently.</seg>
<seg id="47">Beeler from the Asphalt & Rubber blog said his referral traffic showed it got moving on Facebook, caught on in S&M social media circles, then moved into feminist media, catching the attention of mainstream media outlets.</seg>
<seg id="48">Sharma said he is thrilled with the renewed attention.</seg>
<seg id="49">There's been some negative reaction toward both versions, he said, but much more positive attention, overall.</seg>
<seg id="50">"We just did it for fun, for the notoriety, and it went crazy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="51">A lot of people have turned it into something it wasn't intended to be, but that's the beautiful thing about artistic interpretation.</seg>
<seg id="52">Beeler said he hopes it's a wake-up call to the motorcycle industry that female riders might be attracted by a more balanced approach to marketing.</seg>
<seg id="53">"If you want more gender equality in the consumer base, we have to have more gender equality in marketing and the way you're approaching things," he said.</seg>
<seg id="54">Gender roles are still an issue that people find relevant, and I think that's why we saw it getting picked up in niches and exploding from there.</seg>

<seg id="2">1 November 2013 Last updated at 09:03 By Dean McLaughlin BBC News Continue reading the main story</seg>
<seg id="3">Thousands of people lined the streets of Londonderry on Thursday night for a Halloween spectacular involving witches, zombies and superheroes.</seg>
<seg id="4">A Halloween parade by school children and community groups was followed by a firework display.</seg>
<seg id="5">Derry City Council said an estimated 30,000 people were in the city for the celebrations.</seg>
<seg id="6">Six hundred local performers took part in the finale with choreography from the Curious Carnival of the Lost Souls Parade.</seg>
<seg id="7">The parade was the showpiece event in a week-long programme of events.</seg>
<seg id="8">For the three days before Halloween, the landscape theatre company LUXe took families through an Inferno Walk, a world of light, fire, sculpture and circus acts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Frights and delights</seg>
<seg id="10">Celebrations came to an end on Thursday night with a Shapeshifters Ball in the Guildhall at 21:00 GMT.</seg>
<seg id="11">American disco and R&B band Chic also performed on stage at The Venue in Ebrington Square around 21:30 GMT.</seg>
<seg id="12">Jacqueline Whoriskey from Derry City Council said: "We are absolutely delighted with the crowd and the boost it had for the city.</seg>
<seg id="13">Around 25,000 came to the city last year so we are overwhelmed that 30,000 came this year.</seg>
<seg id="14">Halloween is something Derry is good at and we are proud of.</seg>
<seg id="15">The parade travelled along the Strand Road around Harbour Square roundabout and returned to the council car park along Queen's Quay at approximately 19:45 GMT.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Halloween carnival programme also included a special event that combines the celebration of Halloween with marking the 400th anniversary of Derry's historic walls.</seg>
<seg id="17">A number of city artists worked with the City Walls Heritage Project to pay homage to the walls with a host of illuminations, sculptures and props to create a trail of surprises, frights and delights in the run-up to Halloween night.</seg>
<seg id="18">Carnival development officer with Derry City Council, Sharon Meenan, paid tribute to all the hard work in local schools and community groups throughout the city.</seg>
<seg id="19">She said: "As always we have been inundated with local groups who want to take part in the Halloween event.</seg>
<seg id="20">It's fantastic to see so much community involvement this year and I would like to thank all those whose creativity, skill and imagination make the carnival such an amazing spectacle each year.</seg>

<seg id="1">Anger over Bali bomb plotter's sentence</seg>
<seg id="2">Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing have reacted with anger over the sentence given to the last of the plotters to face justice, saying Umar Patek should face a firing squad.</seg>
<seg id="3">Patek, who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of South-East Asia's most wanted, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in jail for his role in building the explosive devices used in the bombing.</seg>
<seg id="4">He could be released within 15 years if granted parole.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta which left 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and injured scores more.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of bombings of churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prosecutors had demanded a life sentence, although they could have pushed that the man dubbed the "Demolition Man" for his reputation as a master bomb-maker be sentenced to death.</seg>
<seg id="8">The decision has reignited painful memories for Perth mother June Corteen, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the destruction unleashed by Patek and his co-conspirators almost a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="9">Fighting back tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.</seg>
<seg id="10">I really feel that he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.</seg>
<seg id="11">"He should be put in front of the firing squad," Ms Corteen told AAP.</seg>
<seg id="12">I have to live every day without seeing more grandchildren, and my daughters.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Sari Club was levelled when a massive bomb loaded into a van parked outside was detonated just after 11pm on October 12, 2002.</seg>
<seg id="14">Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar where a suicide bomber detonated a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.</seg>
<seg id="15">He lapsed into a month-long coma in the wake of the bombing, and "died" three times while on life support.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Hughes said Patek should have shared the same fate as three other members of the Jemaah Islamiah terror cell responsible for the carnage - Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were executed four years ago.</seg>
<seg id="17">Really, this guy should get the death penalty before anybody.</seg>
<seg id="18">To keep him alive, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.</seg>
<seg id="19">To get 20 years, after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds, it's not much.</seg>
<seg id="20">Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to face justice.</seg>
<seg id="21">He had avoided capture for almost a decade but was eventually apprehended in January 2011 in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad, where US forces killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.</seg>
<seg id="22">During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports had revealed Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to re-establish links between South-East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.</seg>
<seg id="23">"He didn't give himself up," Ms Corteen said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Until just recently, he really didn't feel sorry for how much grief he caused other people.</seg>
<seg id="25">The verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack later this year, which will be marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.</seg>
<seg id="26">"There will be a lot of tears this year," Ms Corteen said.</seg>
<seg id="27">Patek may yet appeal his sentence.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pakistani political leader says NATO supply routes will be cut if U.S. drone strikes continue</seg>
<seg id="2">"If drone attacks are carried out during peace talks with Taliban, NATO supplies will be stopped," Khan told reporters at a news conference in the eastern city of Lahore.</seg>
<seg id="3">It was the second time in less than a week that Khan has suggested that local officials could impede NATO convoys passing through northwestern Pakistan to and from the war in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="4">U.S. and NATO officials had no immediate comment, but Khan's threat comes as the U.S. military plans to transport hundreds of millions of dollars" worth of equipment on Pakistani highways ahead of the planned withdrawal of forces by the end of next year.</seg>
<seg id="5">The supply routes were established when U.S. and NATO forces began pouring into landlocked Afghanistan after the Taliban's ouster in late 2001, but the routes were closed for seven months between late 2011 and 2012 after a U.S. airstrike on the border of the two countries killed 24 Pakistani soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="6">Pakistan allowed the NATO convoys to restart in July 2012 after Hillary Rodham Clinton, then secretary of state, apologized for the incident.</seg>
<seg id="7">The U.S. military is moving out the bulk of its equipment from Afghanistan via those routes, the most cost-effective option.</seg>
<seg id="8">The NATO convoys pass through either Khyber Pakhtunkhwa or the southwestern province of Baluchistan on their way to the port city of Karachi.</seg>
<seg id="9">Both routes have been vulnerable to attacks from militants, and shipments have at times stalled at the border in recent months because of corruption and the Afghan government's insistence that the United States pay millions of dollars in customs fees.</seg>
<seg id="10">But Pakistan's government has an agreement with the United States allowing the transports through 2015, and Pakistani security officials help secure the routes.</seg>
<seg id="11">Although Sharif has also tried in the past to tie the supply routes to the drone issue, he has stressed since taking office in June that he hopes for improved relations with the United States.</seg>
<seg id="12">If Khan's provincial government follows through on its threat, analysts say, Sharif will have little choice but to step in and exert his constitutional authority to oversee foreign affairs.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The federal government would be embarrassed and be in a very unpalatable situation of having to act," said Khalid Aziz, former chief secretary of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.</seg>
<seg id="14">It would lead to a political crisis.</seg>
<seg id="15">Tariq Azeem Khan, a former senator and spokesman for the Pakistan Muslim League-Q party, said Imran Khan's comments showed his "political naivete."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Because police come under the local provincial administration, they might try to block them, but without the consensus of the central government, they will not succeed," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Imran Khan, a former international cricket star, mounted a vigorous campaign in Pakistani parliamentary elections this year by stressing his opposition to the drone strikes and calling for a tougher stance against U.S. policy in the region.</seg>
<seg id="18">His party finished third in the national election but won enough seats in Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa to form a coalition government there.</seg>
<seg id="19">From that perch, Khan has maintained his profile as a leading champion of peace talks and an end to the U.S. drone strikes.</seg>
<seg id="20">Under pressure from Khan and others domestically, Sharif has also publicly stressed his opposition to the strikes, even though a recent Washington Post report noted that past Pakistani leaders were frequently briefed on the progress of the U.S. drone campaign.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Sharif's government condemned a suspected U.S. drone strike the night before targeting suspected militants in North Waziristan.</seg>
<seg id="22">No one was killed in the strike, local officials said.</seg>
<seg id="23">"There is an across-the-board consensus [in Pakistan] that these drone strikes must end," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="24">After a meeting at the White House last week, Sharif and President Obama issued a joint statement pledging "robust bilateral defense cooperation" in a number of areas, including the movement of NATO cargo through Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="25">Shaiq Hussain in Islamabad and Ernesto Londoño in Washington contributed to this report.</seg>

<seg id="1">Flying start from top bats is key to Ashes victory</seg>
<seg id="2">Top touch: George Bailey has had a brilliant series against India and is likely to play in the first Test against England at the Gabba.</seg>
<seg id="3">If Australia improves 15 per cent with the bat we can win the Ashes.</seg>
<seg id="4">First, selectors need to sort out who bats where and select guys who are in form.</seg>
<seg id="5">If the Australians put in a strong performance in the first Test at the Gabba, I believe they will go on to win the series.</seg>
<seg id="6">Despite Australia's one-day bowlers being savaged on flat tracks in India, the strength of the Australian Test team, with some key additions, is its bowling.</seg>
<seg id="7">There have been a few injuries, but it has the firepower to get 20 wickets.</seg>
<seg id="8">Don't forget, Australia still needs to field well.</seg>
<seg id="9">Our fielding is below par at times and a potential weakness.</seg>
<seg id="10">If we don't take our catches then we are in big trouble.</seg>
<seg id="11">There has been so much discussion about one-day international tours, Ryobi Cup and Sheffield Shield fixtures, but I think Cricket Australia has got it right.</seg>
<seg id="12">With the exception of George Bailey, every Test batsman will get at least two matches before the Gabba Test.</seg>
<seg id="13">All will get a chance to find out how much they want to play for Australia.</seg>
<seg id="14">I was curious to hear the comments made from John Inverarity, who pretty much said that the Test team has been already selected.</seg>
<seg id="15">That is OK, but I feel the selectors should not advise anyone of the Ashes squad.</seg>
<seg id="16">This admission by Inverarity has upset many state players who haven't had the chance to prove themselves over the next few weeks.</seg>
<seg id="17">I would have loved to see all the players believing they had a chance of being selected.</seg>
<seg id="18">I wanted to maintain the pressure on them, but the selectors feel otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="19">The only certainties in my mind are Chris Rogers, Shane Watson, Michael Clarke and Steve Smith.</seg>
<seg id="20">Even though David Warner had a terrific Ryobi Cup, I still think he needs to get at least one score leading up to the first Test.</seg>
<seg id="21">Even though Watson is back into some serious form, I am still not convinced with him at No.3.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is a difficult position to bat at the best of times and you must want to bat there.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is a spot that you badly want to own.</seg>
<seg id="24">I was gutted when Allan Border sacked me from No.3 and pushed me down the order.</seg>
<seg id="25">History has proven that maybe Border got it right when he replaced me with David Boon.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the past, Watson has got whatever he has wanted.</seg>
<seg id="27">If he is serious about batting No.3, he needs to bat there in the Sheffield Shield.</seg>
<seg id="28">Watson must feel that his career is on the line in this series.</seg>
<seg id="29">If he doesn't perform, the selectors will certainly look for other options.</seg>
<seg id="30">Clarke should bat at No.4.</seg>
<seg id="31">He has hit a lot of balls of late and he will be ready for battle.</seg>
<seg id="32">The No.5 spot will go to Smith.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even though he has got a funny backlift that looks a bit weird, Smith has impressed many with his mental toughness.</seg>
<seg id="34">This will be a huge series for him.</seg>
<seg id="35">So who gets the No.6 spot?</seg>
<seg id="36">Steve Waugh said to me that it is one of the hardest positions to bat.</seg>
<seg id="37">Many times you have to start your innings against a quality spinner or when the old ball is reversing.</seg>
<seg id="38">Also, you might come in when the second new ball is around.</seg>
<seg id="39">So you need to have a sound technique and mental toughness to cover many different situations.</seg>
<seg id="40">This position will go to Bailey.</seg>
<seg id="41">Usman Khawaja, Alex Doolan and Aaron Finch will have to wait.</seg>
<seg id="42">They just have to make some big runs, but they are no doubt on the radar.</seg>
<seg id="43">Even though Bailey had a poor Sheffield Shield season last year with only 258 runs, he is in the form of his life.</seg>
<seg id="44">He could have played the Indian bowlers with a pogo stick if he wanted.</seg>
<seg id="45">But I still feel Bailey needs to play a first-class match to prepare properly for this Ashes series.</seg>
<seg id="46">What has impressed us all is how he has got his runs.</seg>
<seg id="47">He has been simply brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="48">I really liked George the first time I met him.</seg>
<seg id="49">I have been so impressed with his leadership in India.</seg>
<seg id="50">He has been a positive leader who nips bad behaviour in the bud early and has great communication skills.</seg>
<seg id="51">Bailey doesn't seek media attention.</seg>
<seg id="52">He might look just an average player at times, but trust me, he has got some serious game.</seg>
<seg id="53">He is a quality person and is very well respected by the whole team.</seg>
<seg id="54">His brilliant captaincy in India has raised many eyebrows within Cricket Australia.</seg>
<seg id="55">He has given Australian selectors an option.</seg>
<seg id="56">With Bailey's form, don't be surprised if selectors name him vice-captain for the first Test.</seg>
<seg id="57">Bailey's recent captaincy success in India has no doubt put Clarke under a little pressure.</seg>
<seg id="58">If Australia gets beaten badly by England in this series, then the selectors might look to Bailey to lead in the future.</seg>
<seg id="59">Traditionally, Australia doesn't like to have multiple captains in various forms of the game and Bailey might be the perfect fit.</seg>
<seg id="60">But I did say "might."</seg>
<seg id="61">There was a similar near coup in 1987.</seg>
<seg id="62">Allan Border was put under similar pressure to Clarke, when he was told by the Australian Cricket Board chief executive that Dirk Wellham would be vice-captain for the fifth Test in Sydney in 1987.</seg>
<seg id="63">First, Border was furious that Boon was dropped for Wellham.</seg>
<seg id="64">And when told that Wellham was to be made vice-captain, AB flew into a rage that I hadn't seen before or since.</seg>
<seg id="65">Border made it clear that he wouldn't play if Wellham was named vice-captain.</seg>
<seg id="66">No vice-captain was named and we won the match.</seg>
<seg id="67">Sadly for Dirk, he didn't play for Australia again.</seg>
<seg id="68">History tells us that it was a timely prod from the Australian hierarchy.</seg>
<seg id="69">AB never looked back as a captain and later that year we won our first World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="70">Some people think that Clarke needs a little prod to remind him there might be other options for CA if things go bad.</seg>
<seg id="71">All captains come under scrutiny.</seg>
<seg id="72">One thing is certain, if Australia gets smashed in this Ashes series, England will have won four series in a row, which it hasn't done since 1890.</seg>
<seg id="73">And if it does, there will be blood spilt.</seg>
<seg id="74">On and off the ground.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pilot Michael James Pascal charged with abusive after allegedly groping a sleeping 14-year-old girl</seg>
<seg id="2">Off-duty pilot Michael James Pascal allegedly groped the sleeping 14-year-old girl seated next to him on Delta flight from Detroit to Salt Lake City.</seg>
<seg id="3">A UTAH airline pilot is facing federal charges after being accused of groping a 14-year-old girl while he was a passenger on a flight from Detroit to Salt Lake City.</seg>
<seg id="4">Michael James Pascal, 45, of Park City, Utah is charged with abusive sexual contact, shows a criminal complaint filed this week by the US Attorney's Office.</seg>
<seg id="5">The girl told investigators that she woke up from a nap on an October 26 Delta Airlines flight and found Mr Pascal's hand under her, gripping her buttocks, court documents show.</seg>
<seg id="6">Mr Pascal, whose attorney says he works as a pilot for a regional airline carrier that contracts with Delta, told investigators he fell asleep with his hands in his lap and doesn't know how one ended up underneath the girl.</seg>
<seg id="7">The girl told authorities she elbowed Mr Pascal after waking up with his hand underneath her and said, "What the hell are you doing?" documents show</seg>
<seg id="8">She says Mr Pascal pulled his hand out from under her and said, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I was asleep, I have to use the bathroom."</seg>
<seg id="9">She said the armrest that she had pushed down was in the upright position.</seg>
<seg id="10">Pascal said he pulled up the armrest between him and the girl because the man on the other side of him was taking up a lot of room, document show.</seg>
<seg id="11">The girl, who was flying alone, told flight attendants what happened and changed seats.</seg>
<seg id="12">She said Mr Pascal seemed nice earlier in the flight, helping her get a blanket from the flight crew since she was on crutches.</seg>
<seg id="13">But after the incident, she noticed Mr Pascal looking at her in her new seat on the back of the plane in an "annoyed" manner, court documents show.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Pascal told investigators that he doesn't recall where his hand was when he awoke.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Pascal's attorney, Rhome Zabriskie, said his client is in shock about being charged.</seg>
<seg id="16">He has a teenage daughter of his own and has been consistent with his story that he just fell asleep, Mr Zabriskie said.</seg>
<seg id="17">"When he woke up, he realized he had kind of flopped over on the passenger next to him," Zabriskie said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Any touching that occurred was inadvertent.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delta Airlines spokesman Michael Thomas said the airline is cooperating with the investigation, but declined to comment further.</seg>
<seg id="20">The regional airline where Pascal reportedly works declined to confirm or deny if he's an employee.</seg>
<seg id="21">Pascal is scheduled to be in federal court Thursday morning in Salt Lake City for a detention hearing.</seg>

<seg id="1">A Writer Who's Beat in Search of a Refuge</seg>
<seg id="2">"Big Sur" cracks the code of how to adapt Jack Kerouac for the screen.</seg>
<seg id="3">The secret is deceptively simple: Go to the source and stay there.</seg>
<seg id="4">The hot-wired energy and spontaneity of the Beat mystique are embedded in writing that distills its feverish essence better than any hyped-up action.</seg>
<seg id="5">The hard part is melding readings with live action, but "Big Sur" makes it look so easy that you hardly notice the transitions.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trying to capture the paradox of writers embracing life with a near-suicidal ferocity without using their language is probably futile, as Walter Salles's disappointing screen adaptation of "On the Road" (2012) suggested.</seg>
<seg id="7">There were Kerouac quotations in "On the Road" but not nearly enough to sustain the electric current that runs through the much more modest "Big Sur."</seg>
<seg id="8">Based on Kerouac's 1962 novel, the movie is the first feature written and directed by Michael Polish that is not a collaboration with his identical twin brother, Mark.</seg>
<seg id="9">Gorgeously photographed on the central California coast with lingering shots of the crashing surf and shafts of sunlight through redwoods, it offers a vision of paradise that its restless, frenzied characters can only dimly appreciate.</seg>
<seg id="10">The screenplay is a seamless blend of astutely chosen swatches from the novel narrated by Kerouac (Jean-Marc Barr) with scenes of his interactions with Neal Cassady (Josh Lucas); Neal's wife, Carolyn (Radha Mitchell); and Neal's mistress (Kate Bosworth), renamed Billie.</seg>
<seg id="11">Neal, with some trepidation, "gives" Billie as a present to Jack, who falls in love with her and envisions a four-way marriage with the Cassadys.</seg>
<seg id="12">At one point, Jack cruelly forces an awkward meeting between Carolyn and Billie.</seg>
<seg id="13">Before long, Jack falls out of love with Billie, and the breakup is so bitter that he worries that she will drown herself.</seg>
<seg id="14">By the time they break up, Jack is lost to alcoholism and despair.</seg>
<seg id="15">The narrative is structured around his three visits to a cabin in Bixby Canyon in Big Sur, owned by the poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti (Anthony Edwards) that is a kind of oasis and stopover for Beat poets and fellow travelers.</seg>
<seg id="16">They include the poets Michael McClure (Balthazar Getty), Philip Whalen (Henry Thomas) and Lew Welch (Patrick Fischler).</seg>
<seg id="17">An anxious, world-weary tone is established from the outset in a voice-over just before Jack settles in alone at the cabin for rest, but he is soon so bored he flees.</seg>
<seg id="18">Jack's unexpected fame is a curse he can't shake.</seg>
<seg id="19">"All over America high school and college kids are thinking Jack Kerouac is 26 years old and on the road hitchhiking, while there I am, almost 40 years old, bored and jaded," he muses.</seg>
<seg id="20">Mr. Barr, a veteran of Lars von Trier films, is a Kerouac look-alike except for his laughing eyes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Kerouac's expressions in photos were anything but merry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Once Jack throws himself into the North Beach bar life of San Francisco, the movie is an unblinking portrait of the author as an alcoholic in an advanced state of the disease, losing his battle with the bottle and along with it his spirit and faith in art and God.</seg>
<seg id="23">What is especially painful is his awareness of exactly what he's doing and his powerlessness to stop.</seg>
<seg id="24">In one pungent speech, he describes the clinical day-to-day effects of a bender.</seg>
<seg id="25">As many bohemian women had to be in those days, Billie and Carolyn are tough, long-suffering handmaidens who protest their shabby treatment from men but put up with it.</seg>
<seg id="26">Both Ms. Bosworth and Ms. Mitchell are very good, if not especially likable, as adventurous women, hardened by mistreatment, who are drawn toward bad boys.</seg>
<seg id="27">Mr. Edwards's Ferlinghetti is a steadying avuncular presence.</seg>
<seg id="28">As many have written, the Kerouac-Cassady relationship is actually a love story.</seg>
<seg id="29">And that's how they play it: as possible lovers locked into the prevailing "50s concept of masculinity.</seg>
<seg id="30">The major flaw of "Big Sur" is a rushed quasi-happy ending in which Kerouac endures a terrifying psychotic episode, recovers his spirits and decides to go home to Long Island.</seg>
<seg id="31">But it is really an admission of defeat.</seg>
<seg id="32">Filmed without a trace of sentimentality, "Big Sur" is an achingly sad last hurrah.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Big Sur" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for sexuality, nudity and strong language.</seg>
<seg id="34">Big Sur</seg>

<seg id="1">Attempting a Rebound, Markets Are Mixed</seg>
<seg id="2">Stocks on Wall Street were mixed on Friday, as equities attempted a rebound following two days of losses, bolstered by strong data on manufacturing.</seg>
<seg id="3">In afternoon trading the Standard & Poor's 500-share index was down 0.1 percent, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.2 percent and the Nasdaq composite was 0.2 percent lower.</seg>
<seg id="4">European shares turned lower at the end of the week.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Euro Stoxx 50 index of euro zone blue chips ended the session down 0.5 percent, and London's FTSE 100 was closed down 0.8 percent.</seg>
<seg id="6">Reassuring signals on China's factory activity offered support to Asian markets, though Tokyo's Nikkei finished at a one-week low as the yen strengthened against the euro.</seg>
<seg id="7">Equities have been pressured since a Fed statement on Wednesday raised concerns about when the central bank would begin to scale back its stimulus program, which has contributed to the S.&P. 500"s advance of 23 percent this year.</seg>
<seg id="8">The rally has taken the Dow and S.& P. repeatedly to record highs, leading some analysts to call for a pullback, especially amid some signs of slowing growth, like weak economic data and an earnings season marked by tepid revenue.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Investors continue to buy the dips as they believe the Fed will hold steady for a while, and that's helping to give us a bounce today," said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Banyan Partners in New York.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would be somewhat cautious about reentering the market so quickly, since there still are headwinds out there and we haven't pulled back very much from our highs.</seg>
<seg id="11">The United States manufacturing sector last month expanded at its fastest pace in two and a half years, a rate that was stronger than expected, according to the Institute for Supply Management's survey, which followed the similarly strong Chicago Purchasing Manager's Index on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Chevron was the latest company to disappoint on results, posting third-quarter revenue that was below expectations.</seg>
<seg id="13">Shares of the Dow component were down 2.4 percent.</seg>
<seg id="14">Recent economic data has been mixed, with this week's ADP National Employment Report coming in below expectations but the Chicago Purchasing Manager's Index sharply above forecasts.</seg>
<seg id="15">While weak data has been a concern, strong data has spurred selling on expectations it may encourage the Fed to slow its stimulus - something the central bank has said it would do once growth meets its targets.</seg>
<seg id="16">For the week thus far, both the Dow and S&P are down 0.2 percent, coming off three straight weeks of gains, while the Nasdaq has slipped 0.6 percent.</seg>
<seg id="17">On Wednesday, the Fed said it would keep buying $85 billion of bonds per month, but removed a phrase from a previous statement expressing worries about credit conditions, which some investors interpreted as a sign that the Fed could begin tapering stimulus earlier than expected.</seg>
<seg id="18">Previously, market participants were anticipating that the stimulus plan would not change until at least early next year.</seg>
<seg id="19">In company news, American International Group reported third-quarter earnings late Thursday that slightly beat expectations, though analysts had expected better results in the insurer's consumer lines business.</seg>
<seg id="20">Shares fell 6.2 percent.</seg>
<seg id="21">United States-traded shares of Vodafone Group edged 0.3 percent lower following a Bloomberg News report that said AT&T Inc was exploring strategies for a potential takeover of the British mobile operator, citing people familiar with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="22">AT&T rose 0.4 percent.</seg>
<seg id="23">Solar companies will be in focus after First Solar posted results that beat expectations and raised its full-year profit outlook.</seg>

<seg id="1">Difficult Year for Pharmacists</seg>
<seg id="2">The departure of almost 10 pharmacists from the Centre for Health and Social Services (CSSS) in Laval has caused turmoil amidst the managers of the Cité-de-la-Santé hospital in the year 2012-2013.</seg>
<seg id="3">The pharmacy department has been left seriously short-staffed following multiple departures due to retirement, maternity leave or, simply, resignations.</seg>
<seg id="4">There is a staff shortage of almost 30%, making the financial year "very difficult" according to department head, Gillian Beaudet.</seg>
<seg id="5">Even so, the CSSS has decided not to employ independent labour, which could be up to three times more expensive than taking on a full-time pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We didn't resort to a stop-gap solution," explained Beaudet.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We consolidated or reduced some of our activities within the institution to get around while waiting for things to fall back in place.</seg>
<seg id="8">We clearly worked hard on trying to persuade our young [pharmacy residents] to come and stay here.</seg>
<seg id="9">A combination of circumstances put us in a difficult situation last year."</seg>
<seg id="10">Improved situation</seg>
<seg id="11">After this difficult period, 2013-2014 looks like a definitely easier one for the pharmacy department at the CSSS.</seg>
<seg id="12">Three pharmacists have already returned to work after maternity leave and three others have been taken on in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, the efforts made by the department to hold on to staff have paid off, as the four students currently in residence in Laval have also decided to stay on at the CSSS.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Things are going much better now," stressed the pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="15">"By the end of the financial year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three back from maternity leave.</seg>
<seg id="16">So that will fill the gaps we had last year."</seg>
<seg id="17">Need still growing</seg>
<seg id="18">However, the situation is still precarious.</seg>
<seg id="19">Several factors, such as the shortage of pharmacists in hospitals or a predominance of young women in the profession, make situations like that experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.</seg>
<seg id="20">"For us [the number of staff] is always precarious as this is a young environment where a lot of young women are being employed. So in terms of pregnancies, you can always count on three people being on maternity leave when things are going well," she added.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Last year there were many more and there were no pharmacists available to replace them, so it was more difficult."</seg>

<seg id="1">Rio summit shows UN impotence</seg>
<seg id="2">THE outcome of the Rio summit provides further proof that the nation-state system is failing badly in tackling global environmental threats, say analysts.</seg>
<seg id="3">The UN's Conference on Sustainable Development had been billed as a once-in-a-generation chance to overhaul an economic model that had left a billion people in poverty and imperiled the biosphere.</seg>
<seg id="4">But veteran observers who watched the 10-day event drag to a close yesterday shook their heads in dismay.</seg>
<seg id="5">To them, it was a fresh failure by the United Nations system, after the near-disastrous 2009 Copenhagen climate summit, to respond to eco-perils that are now approaching at express speed.</seg>
<seg id="6">"It's a demonstration of political impotence, of system paralysis, and it makes me feel pessimistic about the system's ability to deliver," Laurence Tubiana, director of a French think-tank, the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations (IDDRI), said in an interview.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The multilateral process today is not delivering the urgent action we need," WWF's Jim Leape told AFP in an email.</seg>
<seg id="8">International action is in fact important, to galvanise a global response to these challenges, but it's clear that we need to look to leadership in other places... that means looking for changes everywhere - communities, cities, national governments and companies.</seg>
<seg id="9">After a three-day summit of 189 nation-states, the conference issued a 53-page declaration with the horizon-sweeping title "The Future We Want."</seg>
<seg id="10">It itemised a distressingly long list of problems - from global warming, deforestation and fisheries collapse to water stress, pollution and biodiversity loss that scientists fear could turn into a mass extinction.</seg>
<seg id="11">But long months of textual trench warfare, as nations defended their own interests, meant radical proposals were either watered down or got the chop.</seg>
<seg id="12">They included a commitment to phase out subsidies for fossil fuels and demands for up to $US30 billion ($A29.94 billion) a year to help poor countries grow in a sustainable way.</seg>
<seg id="13">After Copenhagen, some critics said the UN system was genetically incapable of coping with a global environment crisis.</seg>
<seg id="14">Solutions demand sacrifice by all nations, which gives any dissenter the chance to sabotage or weaken a radical deal.</seg>
<seg id="15">But Steve Sawyer, a former Greenpeace campaigner who is now secretary general of a Brussels clean-energy lobby, the Global Wind Energy Council, said the UN still offered hope.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The UN system has lost its way," crippled by the format determined by the victors of World War II, he argued.</seg>
<seg id="17">"For all its warts, it's what we have, and there is no alternative," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">John Kerry says US spying has "reached too far inappropriately" in unprecedented admission</seg>
<seg id="2">John Kerry has indicated a softening of the U.S's defensive stance on its surveillance programmes with an unprecedented admission that on occasions its spying has "reached too far inappropriately."</seg>
<seg id="3">The Secretary of State also admitted that he'd been guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being on "automatic pilot" as incendiary revelations from whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA's spying activities emerged.</seg>
<seg id="4">The leaks have put the US government at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies.</seg>
<seg id="5">Speaking to an open government conference in London via video link, Mr Kerry said: "There is no question that the President and I and others in government have actually learned of some things that had been happening on an automatic pilot because the ability has been there, going back to World War Two and to the very difficult years of the Cold War, and then, of course, 9/11."</seg>
<seg id="6">He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S government to admit that US spying had crossed the line, but emphasised that no one's rights had been abused.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said: "In some cases, it has reached too far inappropriately."</seg>
<seg id="8">And the President is determined to try to clarify and make clear for people and is now doing a thorough review in order that nobody will have the sense of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="9">I assure you innocent people are not being abused in this process.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.</seg>
<seg id="11">He added: "We're dealing in a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up."</seg>
<seg id="12">There is radical extremism in the world that is hell-bent and determined to try to kill people and blow people up and attack governments.</seg>
<seg id="13">So what if you were able to intercept that and stop it before it happens?</seg>
<seg id="14">We have actually prevented airplanes from going down, buildings from being blown up, and people from being assassinated because we've been able to learn ahead of time of the plans.</seg>
<seg id="15">Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will head to Europe to help address concerns abroad about alleged U.S. spying and convince the Europeans of the need to continue joint anti-terrorism efforts with the U.S., the chairman of a Senate subcommittee on European affairs said on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke with European Parliament members and others this week and is concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations because of frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency.</seg>
<seg id="17">"It's really important for U.S. national security interests for Europeans to stay on board with us with respect to our mutual anti-terrorism endeavors," Murphy, a first-term Democrat and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, said in an interview from Washington.</seg>
<seg id="18">And I'm going to Europe to make it clear to them that we need to continue to work together in combatting terrorism, notwithstanding their anger over these NSA programs.</seg>
<seg id="19">News reports that the NSA swept up millions of phone records in Europe have frayed relations with some U.S. allies, though the agency's chief said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of metadata that Nato allies collected and shared with the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">Other revelations cited documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cellphone and those of up to 34 other world leaders.</seg>
<seg id="21">The national intelligence director, James Clapper, defended spying on allies as necessary and said it's commonplace on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="22">Amid the uproar, Murphy said his office is arranging the congressional trip, expected to take place this year, and hopes the delegation will include members of both parties and both chambers.</seg>
<seg id="23">Names of other participating lawmakers were to be released in coming days.</seg>
<seg id="24">He said the itinerary is still being worked out.</seg>
<seg id="25">While Murphy said the purpose of the trip is to help improve relationships, he said some "tough love" will also be dispensed.</seg>
<seg id="26">He said European leaders need to be honest with their own people about the kind of espionage programs they've used for years themselves.</seg>
<seg id="27">"While we can amend our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also need to come to terms with the fact that we're not the only ones that are out there spying," Murphy said.</seg>
<seg id="28">Meanwhile, Mr Kerry is scheduled to head this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to address rancor over U.S. strategies in the Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as U.S. surveillance activities.</seg>

<seg id="1">Toronto police find video purported to show mayor smoking crack</seg>
<seg id="2">A dormant scandal over Toronto Mayor Rob Ford's alleged drug use flared anew Thursday when the city's police chief disclosed that a video purportedly showing Ford smoking crack cocaine had been recovered from a computer seized in a related drug probe.</seg>
<seg id="3">Canadian media swarmed to Ford's suburban home to confront him over the video, which journalists from the Toronto Star and the U.S. gossip site Gawker had reported viewing in May.</seg>
<seg id="4">The mayor at the time vehemently denied that he used drugs or that the video existed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Police Chief Bill Blair told the media earlier Thursday that an ongoing drug investigation netted a hard drive from which the video had been erased but was recovered by forensic experts.</seg>
<seg id="6">Gawker said the discovery had renewed a police probe into Ford's alleged drug use.</seg>
<seg id="7">In its May report, the Star described the mayor as appearing "impaired" in the 90-second video segment, and said he could be heard making homophobic and racial slurs.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The video files depict images that are consistent with what has previously been reported," Blair said at a news conference, referring to the Star and Gawker accounts in May.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's safe to say the mayor does appear in the video.</seg>
<seg id="10">The digital video reportedly depicting the mayor smoking something in a glass pipe was recovered by investigators Tuesday from a computer hard drive from which it had been erased earlier, the Canadian news reports said.</seg>
<seg id="11">The discovery resulted from an investigation last summer of reports of the mayor's alleged drug use and frequent contact with accused drug dealer and friend, Alexander Lisi, according to the Star and other Toronto media.</seg>
<seg id="12">Dubbed Brazen 2, the investigation involved weeks of clandestine surveillance of the mayor and Lisi.</seg>
<seg id="13">Investigators produced a 480-page "information to obtain" document to gain court approval for search warrants, the Globe and Mail said in its report on the revived scandal.</seg>
<seg id="14">Blair announced at his news conference that Lisi, arrested earlier this month on narcotics charges, had been taken into custody again Thursday and would be facing an additional charge of extortion.</seg>
<seg id="15">Reporters descended on the mayor's home after the police chief's revelations, but Ford refused then to discuss the matter, ordering them to "get off my driveway" before taking off in his SUV.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ford later held a news conference where he said he was constrained from commenting on the video by the ongoing investigation of Lisi.</seg>
<seg id="17">I wish I could come out and defend myself.</seg>
<seg id="18">Unfortunately I can't because it's before the courts.</seg>
<seg id="19">"That's all I can say," Ford said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Asked if he planned to heed the calls of other civic leaders that he step down from office, Ford replied that he had "no reason to resign."</seg>
<seg id="21">Ford had denied he used drugs when the media reports first appeared, and declined to comment on the reported video, insisting it "does not exist," CBC news reported in an anthology of the mayor's responses to past allegations.</seg>
<seg id="22">Ford has repeatedly attributed the scandal to "the Toronto Star going after me."</seg>
<seg id="23">Blair said the investigation of the mayor was continuing but that authorities lacked grounds at this point to bring charges.</seg>

<seg id="1">Red Sox finish off Cardinals in World Series</seg>
<seg id="2">BOSTON - At the end of the fourth inning Wednesday night, the Boston Police Department issued a statement reporting that the bars in the Kenmore Square area were filled and telling people without game tickets to leave the area.</seg>
<seg id="3">The sense of anticipation wasn't lost on a community ready to celebrate the Red Sox's first World Series clinching at Fenway Park since 1918 and completely rid themselves of the pain of a last-place finish in the American League East in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="4">The early celebration was understandable after the Red Sox pounced on rookie Michael Wacha for six runs in the first four innings and relied on the strong pitching of John Lackey to cruise to a 6-1 victory and top the St. Louis Cardinals four games to two in the best-of-seven series.</seg>
<seg id="5">"There was definitely a madness, a vibe in the place that was pretty special," Lackey said after pitching 62/3 innings.</seg>
<seg id="6">Lackey earned the distinction of winning a second World Series clincher, equaling his achievement as a rookie with the Angels in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I'll appreciate it a lot more this time," Lackey said.</seg>
<seg id="8">I was a rookie then and trying to help out and do my best.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was a long time to get back to this point.</seg>
<seg id="10">I'm definitely enjoying it and will appreciate it a lot more.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Red Sox won their third World Series title in 10 seasons and first under Manager John Farrell.</seg>
<seg id="12">This Red Sox team carved its niche with a massive makeover starting midway through 2012 that carried over to spring training with major contributions from newcomers Shane Victorino, Mike Napoli and Jonny Gomes, all of whom played significant roles in knocking out Wacha, who had given up three runs in 29 playoff innings.</seg>
<seg id="13">Victorino, who sat out Games 4 and 5 because of back stiffness, ripped a three-run double off the Green Monster in left field to end a scoreless tie in the third inning and singled to cap a three-run fourth.</seg>
<seg id="14">Stephen Drew broke out of a four-for-51 postseason slump with a leadoff home run in the fourth.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I'm really glad it happened," Drew said.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was just a matter of time.</seg>
<seg id="17">With these 25 guys, this is what it's about.</seg>
<seg id="18">I couldn't have cared less if I had no hits and played good defense as long as we won this game.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those collective contributions mirrored what Farrell detected as early as after the Boston Marathon bombing in April, when five groups of players went to hospitals to visit victims.</seg>
<seg id="20">"It's hard for me to put sports over a tragedy like that," Lackey said.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hopefully, people who were affected by it can forget about it for a few hours, at least.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Game 6, the Red Sox didn't have to rely on slugger David Ortiz, who walked four times after an 11-for-15 performance in the first five games and was selected the Series' most valuable player.</seg>

<seg id="1">For a truly healthy Britain, we need strong cities across the country</seg>
<seg id="2">Actually, Q3 growth saw both manufacturing and construction rising more strongly than the overall GDP rate of 0.8pc so, in terms of the very latest evidence, some of those observations wouldn't be true.</seg>
<seg id="3">In many ways, it confirms that the most recent evidence of growth has been quite balanced and more sectors are sharing in the recovery.</seg>
<seg id="4">Good employment data and signs that bank lending is increasing suggest this kind of optimism, too.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, it is true that the services sector is now back above its 2008 size, while the construction and manufacturing sectors still remain quite a bit smaller.</seg>
<seg id="6">To achieve real rebalancing, we need even stronger manufacturing.</seg>
<seg id="7">Also, exports and investment are not rising strongly yet.</seg>
<seg id="8">With CPI inflation rising 2.7pc year on year, real wages are showing few signs of picking up sharply.</seg>
<seg id="9">This means few people feel they are entirely sharing in this healthier economy.</seg>
<seg id="10">But I believe we have to be careful here, because if wages were to start rising sharply in nominal terms, and it was not supported by improvements in productivity, our next challenge could become a bigger than desired underlying rise in inflation.</seg>
<seg id="11">This would create a whole new set of more distant, yet familiar, problems.</seg>
<seg id="12">To help minimise these kinds of challenges, more steps need to be taken in terms of true supply side initiatives, especially for many of our regions outside London and the South East.</seg>
<seg id="13">I am chairing a Cities Growth Commission, run by the Royal Society of Arts; our purpose is to seek evidence about how we can boost urban growth outside the prosperous South East.</seg>
<seg id="14">Linked to the concepts behind the rise of the so-called Bric (Brazil, Russia, India and China) and other large emerging economies, well populated areas with strong productivity usually experience the best economic growth, and indeed, rising prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some of the world's most successful economies, including China, Germany and the US, all have a significant number of buoyant cities but not one highly dominant one, as we do here.</seg>
<seg id="16">Indeed, in the UK's glory days as a world manufacturing giant, we had more than one strong city and the experience of the US today suggests this is still possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Cities Growth Commission will not be yet another attempt to resurrect regional growth strategies based on subsidies and special tax breaks (most of which haven't helped in the long term), but focus on initiatives to help education, skills, infrastructure and involve disadvantaged members of local communities.</seg>
<seg id="18">Even in some cities whose shinier, vibrant centres show signs of improved life, something is missing and that is the involvement of all their urban communities.</seg>
<seg id="19">They need to be employed and enjoying active social lives.</seg>
<seg id="20">These are long-standing social challenges, but north-eastern cities in the US, such as Boston, and German cities such as Hamburg show that urban prosperity can be regenerated.</seg>
<seg id="21">If future governments here could achieve something similar in the UK, they would be entitled to boast of a truly gratifying economic recovery.</seg>

<seg id="2">Prime Minister Julia Gillard says she will legislate to increase the Medicare levy.</seg>
<seg id="3">Picture: Hamish Blair Source: Herald Sun</seg>
<seg id="4">THE federal government's tax hike to help pay for a new national disability care scheme could pass parliament in two weeks, after the coalition offered to support the measure.</seg>
<seg id="5">Opposition Leader Tony Abbott has agreed to consider a 0.5 percentage point rise in the Medicare levy to two per cent, neutralising a key election issue for Labor Prime Minister Julia Gillard.</seg>
<seg id="6">Following talks with shadow ministers overnight and Thursday, Mr Abbott said the coalition recognised the need to secure funding for DisabilityCare, despite Labor's "mismanagement" of the federal budget.</seg>
<seg id="7">This morning Mr Abbott said the Coalition was prepared to consider supporting a "modest increase" to the Medicare levy to help fund the scheme.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Opposition Leader said he wanted the issue to be dealt with in this parliament, but called on Julia Gillard to release more details on how the scheme would be fully funded.</seg>
<seg id="9">Federal opposition leader Tony Abbott says the coalition will consider supporting an increase to the Medicare levy to fund the NDIS.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We want this scheme to come into being as soon as possible because we want millions of vulnerable Australians to have the security and assurance they deserve," Mr Abbott said.</seg>
<seg id="11">But at the same time ... it is important the Prime Minister come clean with all of the details on this scheme.</seg>
<seg id="12">How will it be fully funded?</seg>
<seg id="13">We do want to see this come into the parliament in this term.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ms Gillard now plans to introduce a bill during the budget session of parliament beginning May 14.</seg>
<seg id="15">All eyes will be on Tony Abbott today as he responds to the PM's challenge to back an NDIS funding proposal.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I am very pleased that today the leader of the opposition has said ... he is prepared to support an increase," she told reporters in Launceston.</seg>
<seg id="17">The leader of the opposition has changed his mind on this matter.</seg>
<seg id="18">On the basis of that change of mind by the leader of the opposition, I will bring to the parliament the legislation to increase the Medicare levy by half a per cent.</seg>
<seg id="19">This means the bill to enact the increase will be introduced to parliament before the September federal election.</seg>
<seg id="20">Mr Abbott's consideration rests on a number of conditions and he's promised to scrap the impost if the coalition wins the September election and the budget returns to strong surplus.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ms Gillard said most of the detail had already been legislated, while work on the remainder was under way.</seg>
<seg id="22">Other funding details will be available in the budget due on May 14.</seg>
<seg id="23">Labor could have had the support of the Greens and enough cross-benchers to pass the bill, although it risked a battle with the Greens in the Senate if the minor party tried to link the bill with a widening of the mining tax.</seg>
<seg id="24">Prime Minister Julia Gillard has announced a 0.5 percent increase to the Medicare Levy to support the National Disability Insurance Scheme.</seg>
<seg id="25">Courtesy ABC News</seg>
<seg id="26">The prime minister said to get lasting reform she needed the coalition's support.</seg>
<seg id="27">Ms Gillard yesterday announced Labor would seek to increase the Medicare levy from 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent to pay for disability support.</seg>
<seg id="28">The Medicare levy increase will raise about $3.3 billion a year - less than half the $8 billion or more annual cost to run the disability care scheme when it begins full operation from 2018/19.</seg>
<seg id="29">To fill the funding gap, Labor needs to make further budget savings and the states and territories will also need to contribute.</seg>
<seg id="30">There are just five sitting weeks left of parliament in the Lower House before the September election.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Senate will sit for just three weeks before September 14.</seg>
<seg id="32">Mr Abbott said he had always been supportive of a National Disability Insurance Scheme and a bipartisan approach to seeing it made reality.</seg>
<seg id="33">"I would not be riding more than 1000 kilometres to support Carers Australia if I wasn't fair dinkum about a NDIS," Mr Abbott said.</seg>
<seg id="34">I am profoundly committed to a National Disability Insurance Scheme.</seg>
<seg id="35">I have been calling from the beginning for a bipartisan approach to this.</seg>
<seg id="36">Mr Abbott said it was important that the issue be dealt with in this parliament so that it had a "substantial monument."</seg>
<seg id="37">Disability campaigner and former NSW Labor minister John Della Bosca said Thursday's outcome was "fantastic."</seg>
<seg id="38">"We've seen the best of Australian politics in Julia Gillard and Tony Abbott showing great leadership," he said.</seg>
<seg id="39">Meanwhile, department store Myer has apolgosied after its chief executive Bernie Brookes sparked outrage and boycott threats by saying the levy rise wasn't "good for our customers," who would have less money to spend at his department stores.</seg>
<seg id="40">Disability discrimination commissioner Graeme Innes was furious about Mr Brookes' comments and demanded Myer employ 10 per cent more disabled people by 2015.</seg>
<seg id="41">Earlier this morning Mr Abbott called on Ms Gillard to release the full eligibility criteria for the scheme.</seg>
<seg id="42">He said when that came out a lot of Australians would be "disappointed" when they realised they would not be included.</seg>
<seg id="43">But Disability Reform Minister Jenny Macklin brushed off his concerns.</seg>
<seg id="44">"The Leader of The Opposition should read the legislation that he voted for at the end of March," Ms Macklin said.</seg>
<seg id="45">The eligibility of criteria is very clear in the legislation.</seg>
<seg id="46">It is not responsible to raise these issues when you have voted for this legislation just over a month ago.</seg>
<seg id="47">The indication of support from Mr Abbott came as Tasmania became the fourth state to sign up to the multi-billion-dollar NDIS.</seg>
<seg id="48">Ms Gillard and Tasmanian Premier Lara Giddings signed a deal this morning to secure funding for the scheme.</seg>
<seg id="49">In a statement following his press conference Mr Abbott said the NDIS was "too important to become a partisan football."</seg>
<seg id="50">"Australians with a disability and their carers want the confidence that the NDIS means a permanent change in the way that our country supports people with a disability," he said.</seg>
<seg id="51">People with a disability should not have to wait any longer than is necessary for the support they need.</seg>
<seg id="52">Mr Abbott said if elected the Coalition would ensure the Medicare levy increase was only temporary.</seg>
<seg id="53">"If elected to government the Coalition would resolve to ensure that the increase to the Medicare levy is a temporary increase and will be removed when the budget returns to strong surplus and the NDIS can be funded without it," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Euro tumbles on ECB rate cut speculation</seg>
<seg id="2">The euro fell sharply on Thursday after data showing eurozone inflation at its weakest in nearly 4 years prompted speculation that the European Central Bank could soon take action to avert the risk of Japan-style deflation.</seg>
<seg id="3">The euro has been one of the strongest major currencies this year, supported by a hefty current account surplus, a resumption of capital inflows to equity markets and a broader perception that its long-term survival is no longer in doubt.</seg>
<seg id="4">It has also regained a role as a haven currency as uncertainty over US monetary policy and aggressive monetary easing in Japan reduced the attractions of the dollar and yen.</seg>
<seg id="5">Even after Thursday's fall of 1 per cent to $1.3595 against the dollar, it has gained almost 5 per cent against the US currency in the past year - a move that is proving painful for many eurozone exporters.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, October's inflation print of 0.7 per cent, coupled with data showing unemployment stuck at a record high, will increase the pressure on ECB policy makers to discuss a further cut in interest rates when they meet next week.</seg>
<seg id="7">Although they have said they do not see the euro's recent appreciation as a concern, the currency's strength is a further factor that will limit inflation.</seg>
<seg id="8">We do not expect a monetary policy move at the next meeting as it can be argued that the internal devaluation is part of the necessary process of correction of imbalances . . .</seg>
<seg id="9">"Nonetheless, it is to be expected that President Mario Draghi will in all likelihood be grilled on the deflation threats at the next press conference," wrote François Cabau, economist at Barclays.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The print will fuel expectations of a rate cut next week and a dovish statement," said Valentin Marinov, strategist at Citi, adding: "The ECB president could highlight the link between currency appreciation and eurozone disinflation."</seg>
<seg id="11">Many analysts think the euro is now vulnerable to a change in market sentiment, since currency speculators had placed heavy bets on its rise that they might now unwind.</seg>
<seg id="12">Steven Saywell, strategist at BNP Paribas, argues that the market had underpriced the risk of the ECB cutting rates in December, leaving "substantial scope" for the euro to weaken over the next few weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ian Stannard, analyst at Morgan Stanley, said portfolio inflows that had supported the single currency in recent months could also slacken, since valuations of European equities no longer looked as attractive.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Marinov argued that the effect of a strong euro on corporate earnings could itself deter future demand for European assets, saying: "Given the importance of equity inflows for the euro outperformance, we suspect that evidence that these flows are abating could add to the headwinds for the single currency across the board."</seg>
<seg id="15">The euro also weakened sharply against sterling, falling 1.1 per cent to trade at £0.8473.</seg>

<seg id="4">It's unclear if her suggestion is real or merely a radio station stunt</seg>
<seg id="5">But such an idea has been met with outrage online</seg>
<seg id="6">"Wrong strategy for a real problem" is a sentiment shared by many</seg>

<seg id="10">(CNN) -- I know whose house I would avoid on Halloween if I lived in Fargo, North Dakota.</seg>
<seg id="11">Instead of handing out candy, a local woman called into a radio station, saying she plans to pass out letters to trick-or-treaters she feels are "moderately obese."</seg>
<seg id="12">How do you say killjoy?</seg>
<seg id="13">"I just want to send a message to the parents of kids that are really overweight," said the woman, who identified herself only as Cheryl, during an interview with WDAY-FM radio in Fargo.</seg>
<seg id="14">"I think it's just really irresponsible of parents to just sort of send them out looking for free candy just 'cause all of the other kids are doing it," she said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Read: Am I a bad parent if I give my kids candy?</seg>
<seg id="16">Since news of such a Halloween plan went viral, people have called CNN affiliate KXJB-TV questioning whether the story is a hoax, according to the station.</seg>

<seg id="18">Follow us on Twitter and Facebook for the latest stories and tell us what's influencing your life.</seg>
<seg id="19">But "Rat," WDAY-FM's morning co-host, told CNN it was definitely not a radio station stunt.</seg>
<seg id="20">"The woman Cheryl did call into our show," he said.</seg>
<seg id="21">We have been unable to get her back on the phone.</seg>
<seg id="22">It remains unclear if the woman truly plans to hand out obesity letters or if this was all a prank.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Whether Cheryl goes through with handing out letters or not seems to be a Halloween mystery," said JT Thaden, brand manager for WDAY-FM.</seg>
<seg id="24">If any local children do get a letter, we're encouraging them to stop by (our) studios and we'll exchange it for a piece of candy.</seg>
<seg id="25">The radio station said the woman e-mailed it the following message for parents: "Your child is, in my opinion, moderately obese and should not be consuming sugar and treats to the extent of some children this Halloween season.</seg>
<seg id="26">My hope is that you will step up as a parent and ration candy this Halloween and not allow your child to continue these unhealthy eating habits.</seg>
<seg id="27">Her goal, she said in the interview, is spurring action to battle a communitywide problem.</seg>
<seg id="28">Their kids are everybody's kids.</seg>
<seg id="29">It's a whole village," she said.</seg>
<seg id="30">CNN iReport contributor Tony Posnanski said he was motivated to write a response of his own after hearing about what he calls the "fat-shaming letter."</seg>
<seg id="31">Any kind of fat letter is just a shame.</seg>
<seg id="32">It doesn't solve anything, it just shames people," he said in his iReport.</seg>
<seg id="33">Prank or not, Posnanski said the whole concept could still affect people.</seg>
<seg id="34">It can influence others to send in fat letters, too.</seg>
<seg id="35">When I was a child, I was overweight.</seg>
<seg id="36">I think the more that people pointed it out, it only put me through hell.</seg>
<seg id="37">Posnanski said he plans to hand out his own positive letter along with Halloween candy to trick-or-treaters, pointing out how "awesome" they are.</seg>
<seg id="38">I don't think (my letter) is going to affect kids or parents, but it is better than handing out fat letters.</seg>
<seg id="39">This is a holiday for kids to have fun; this isn't a holiday for candy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="40">Plenty of people in my social community had some other choice words.</seg>
<seg id="41">"This is despicable," said Sue Scheff, author of the book "Wit's End: Advice and Resources for Saving Your Out-of-Control Teen," on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="42">Talk about giving a child a complex and deflating their self-esteem especially in front of their peers.</seg>
<seg id="43">Holy cr*p!</seg>
<seg id="44">This is just plain mean," said Sarah Winer Maizes of Los Angeles, a children's book author and blogger, also on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="45">It's just plain heartless.</seg>
<seg id="46">Can we videotape someone giving her a 'you're a heinous creature of a human being' note?</seg>
<seg id="47">"This is terrible, particularly for the girls already overly concerned about body image," said new mom Katie Resnick Lamoureux of Hyannis, Massachusetts.</seg>
<seg id="48">Opinion: 'Fat letters' from schools to parents are wrong</seg>
<seg id="49">Lynn Grefe, president and CEO of the National Eating Disorders Association, agrees, saying such a concept, along with letters from schools to parents about a child's body mass index, would be the wrong way to go.</seg>
<seg id="50">"So-called 'fat letters' have no place in schools and certainly no place in our kids' Halloween buckets and bags," Grefe said.</seg>
<seg id="51">Bringing attention to a child's weight and size in this way is yet one more thoughtless approach that targets and bullies children, putting them at risk for low self-esteem and ultimately developing an eating disorder.</seg>
<seg id="52">She added, "Health should be assessed by a medical doctor, certainly not a stranger who might be dressed as one."</seg>
<seg id="53">Everyone in my social networking circles was horrified by the North Dakotan's possible approach, but some also recognized there's a real problem.</seg>
<seg id="54">CNN's Kelly Wallace: "I know whose house I would avoid on Halloween if I lived in Fargo, North Dakota."</seg>
<seg id="55">"I agree that the community as a whole should support and promote healthy lifestyles because it does take a village, but this is not the way to go about it," said Janet Abrams Piechota on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="56">Said a reader who goes by the Twitter handle @nunoc3, "Wrong strategy for a real problem."</seg>
<seg id="57">"Maybe she should just give out healthy snacks to all," @patgee59 tweeted.</seg>
<seg id="58">Don't be the fat monitor.</seg>
<seg id="59">Yes, she can join the small number of families (less than 5% according to a poll for a story I did a few years back) who give out healthy snacks -- raisins, fruit, even toothbrushes and dental floss on Halloween.</seg>
<seg id="60">Read: Halloween, behind the scenes with Martha</seg>
<seg id="61">Like the woman in North Dakota, I guess these families also have good intentions, but come on, folks, it's Halloween.</seg>
<seg id="62">Mike Adamick, a stay-at-home dad in San Francisco, had another idea.</seg>
<seg id="63">I want to hand out letters to people who hand out raisins or dental floss ... although with a kid there, I suppose the correct response would be, 'Thank you.'</seg>
<seg id="64">Still, killjoys," said the blogger and author of the book, "Dad's Book of Awesome Projects."</seg>
<seg id="65">I agree, which is why I sent my children to school with what my husband called an "unconscionable" amount of candy in small baggies to give out to their friends.</seg>
<seg id="66">Now I just hope their moms don't send me a letter.</seg>

<seg id="1">Former Gestapo Chief Buried in Jewish Cemetery</seg>
<seg id="2">Heinrich Muller, who was never found after disappearing at the end of the Second World War, was actually buried in a common grave in a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, the head of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, confirmed to Bild.</seg>
<seg id="3">Muller did not survive the war.</seg>
<seg id="4">"His body was buried in a common grave in the Jewish cemetery in Berlin Mitte in 1945," he confirmed in the popular daily newspaper, basing his statement on archives.</seg>
<seg id="5">This revelation comes 68 years after the fall of Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime and solves one of the big post-War mysteries.</seg>
<seg id="6">The German Secret Service, the BND, declared in summer 1949 that Muller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.</seg>
<seg id="7">But the secret services were completely wrong.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Muller's body was found in August 1945 by a commando in a temporary grave near the former Ministry of Aviation of the Reich," says Mr. Tuchel.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was wearing "a general's uniform".</seg>
<seg id="10">"His service papers and photo, amongst other things, were found in the inside left pocket," he continued.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bild also published a document from the borough hall of the Mitte district in Berlin, indicating that he had been buried in the district's Jewish cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="12">The president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Dieter Graumann, said he was shocked by the revelation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Finding that one of the most brutal Nazi sadists was buried in a Jewish cemetery is an abhorrent enormity, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">"The memory of the victims is being trampled underfoot in the worst manner," he said disgustedly in the paper.</seg>
<seg id="15">Heinrich Muller was one of the major figures in the Third Reich never to be captured.</seg>
<seg id="16">He took part in the Wannsee Conference in January 1942, where the "final solution" was decided upon, and notably was in command of Adolf Eichmann, who was responsible for the "logistics" of the extermination of the Jews and who was sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.</seg>

<seg id="2">Delta Centre-Ville Hotel in Montreal closed its doors on Thursday after 36 years of existence.</seg>
<seg id="3">The investment fund that owned the building sold it to developers who will convert it into student residences.</seg>
<seg id="4">The hotel had three hundred and fifty employees.</seg>
<seg id="5">Of these, 200 have still not found a new job.</seg>
<seg id="6">Delta has promised not to abandon its employees.</seg>
<seg id="7">Employers have come to meet employees on site and have met with the employees individually to assess their needs.</seg>
<seg id="8">"That support will continue for the next six months," explains the regional labour relations director at Delta hotels, Felix Bisson.</seg>
<seg id="9">The closure of the Delta comes at a time of great competitiveness in the hotel market.</seg>
<seg id="10">The investment fund that owned the building had to make a choice.</seg>
<seg id="11">It had to either reinvest in the building to continue using it, which would require investments worth tens of millions of dollars while competition is fierce as a lot of new hotels have appeared in Montreal.</seg>
<seg id="12">or sell it to someone else, which is what happened," explains Paul Arsenault, holder of the Transat Chair in Tourism at the School of Management at the UQAM.</seg>
<seg id="13">Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza, which will become a home for the elderly.</seg>
<seg id="14">Meanwhile, four hotel projects totaling almost 600 rooms will be implemented in the next two years.</seg>

<seg id="2">Baku is the capital and largest city of Azerbaijan.</seg>
<seg id="3">Known as the City of Contrasts, Baku boasts an interesting blend of traditional values and modern goals.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2015 this unique city on the southern shores of the Caspian Sea will host the very first European Games.</seg>
<seg id="5">The inaugural edition of the Games - which will be the first pan-continental multi-sport event, will involve some 6000 athletes from the 49 Olympic nations of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="6">Eighteen different sports will be on the menu for the 2015 Games although the European Olympic Committee (EOC) has confirmed that negotiations are ongoing to secure the inclusion of athletics.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Baku Organising Committee is chaired by Azerbaijan's First Lady Mehriban Aliyeva, who this week welcomed members of the EOC's coordination commission who were in town to inspect and assess the progress in preparations for the Games.</seg>
<seg id="8">For the first time the curtains were lifted on some of the iconic venues and spaces that will be used to stage the first European Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">One of the venues is the Crystal Hall, which staged the highly acclaimed Eurovision 2012.</seg>
<seg id="10">IOC executive board member and president of the European Olympic Committee Patrick Hickey was on the tour of the city and was full of praise for the indoor arena which will host five sports - Boxing, volleyball, taekwondo, fencing and karate.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hickey who is also member of the coordination commission for the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio said: I'm very impressed with the Crystal Hall.</seg>
<seg id="12">I have been here before, I was actually here for the Eurovision song contest so I know what a wonderful venue it is.</seg>
<seg id="13">Yeah, O think it will generate a great atmosphere for the athletes and the fans.</seg>
<seg id="14">I think it would be superb."""</seg>
<seg id="15">Youth and Sports minister Azad Rahimov says the Games can only be beneficial for Azabaijan.</seg>
<seg id="16">He said: Of course it is very important for a young country like ours with only 21 years of independence, to have this position on the map of the world and to be a part of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="17">And of course we are Europe, and we are open to Europe and to be integrated into Europe as much as to welcome Europe to Azerbaijan.</seg>
<seg id="18">""We feel now there is a change going on in different fields all around the country, in difference organisations, government organisations."</seg>
<seg id="19">"We have improved the transport system, a lot of people will be taught and educated during the Games and they will have a great experience for the future."""</seg>
<seg id="20">The media tour also included the a trip to the Athletes Village located in the city.</seg>
<seg id="21">Newly renovated new apartment blocks have been put aside to house the international athletes.</seg>
<seg id="22">And according to Erkin Nasirli, the Strategy and project manger of the village and games services, the luxurious, spacious and well-fitted apartments will be appreciated by all who stay there.</seg>
<seg id="23">"He said: ""The main goal for any athlete village I believe is to accomodate them (the athletes) so they do not have any difficulties or problems and I think this village will definitely come to the standard they expect."""</seg>
<seg id="24">With investments in a new airport terminal as well as transport projects and many other infrastructure and city enhancement projects - Baku is readying itself to make history in June 2015 by launching the very first European Games.</seg>
<seg id="25">It will certainly be another major event to be firmly placed in the international sporting calendar.</seg>

<seg id="1">New anti-nicotine vaccine could take the pleasure out of smoking</seg>
<seg id="2">Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could take the pleasure out of smoking a cigarette.</seg>
<seg id="3">A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice against nicotine addiction for life.</seg>
<seg id="4">Further tests are needed before starting human trials, which would take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the early signs are good.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccine strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all the methods on the market today, but find their nicotine addiction to be strong enough to overcome these current approaches," Prof Cornell said.</seg>
<seg id="6">The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been engineered to carry the genetic information to make anti-nicotine antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="7">The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then start to make a steady stream of the antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="8">The antibodies hunt down any nicotine molecules in the bloodstream, neutralising them before they reached the brain, preventing a smoker from getting a nicotine hit.</seg>
<seg id="9">In tests, vaccinated mice who were subsequently given nicotine continued with their normal activity.</seg>
<seg id="10">But mice who had not been given the vaccine "chilled out," say the researchers, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains.</seg>
<seg id="11">The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="12">Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="13">The jabs had to be given so frequently to keep antibody levels topped up that they proved expensive and impractical.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be far lower, because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.</seg>
<seg id="15">Prof Crystal said that if a future human vaccine was completely safe it could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.</seg>
<seg id="16">But more likely it would be used by smokers to quit.</seg>
<seg id="17">"They will know if they start smoking again, they will receive no pleasure from it due to the nicotine vaccine, and that can help them kick the habit," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">British scientists said the results were interesting but warned far more research was needed.</seg>

<seg id="1">What is happening to the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia?</seg>
<seg id="2">Even after loud complaints from top Saudi officials that the longtime alliance was on the rocks, the response of official Washington, outside the punditocracy, was an almost audible yawn.</seg>
<seg id="3">President Barack Obama's administration should not be so quick to dismiss the trouble the Saudis could cause for the United States in the Middle East -- or the Saudi royals' determination to cause a shift in U.S. policy.</seg>
<seg id="4">Two articles this month quoted unidentified "European diplomats" who had been briefed by Saudi intelligence maestro Prince Bandar bin Sultan that Riyadh was so upset with Washington that it was undertaking a "major shift" in relations.</seg>
<seg id="5">Saudi Arabia has a litany of complaints about U.S. policy in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="6">It faults Washington for pursuing a rapprochement with Iran, for not pushing Israel harder in peace talks with the Palestinians, and for not more forcefully backing efforts to topple Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.</seg>
<seg id="7">Saudi royals are also angry that the United States did not stand behind Saudi support for Bahrain when it crushed an anti-government uprising in 2011, and that Washington has criticized the new Egyptian government, another Saudi ally, for its crackdown on Muslim Brotherhood protesters.</seg>
<seg id="8">Saudi royals have evidently decided that public comments and policy shifts are the only way to convince Washington to alter what they see as its errant path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Bandar's declaration came a few days after the kingdom abruptly decided to reject its election to the U.N. Security Council, claiming it could not tolerate that body's "double standards."</seg>
<seg id="10">As Bandar helpfully pointed out, the incident was "a message for the U.S., not the U.N."</seg>
<seg id="11">According to an official in Washington, Bandar's "briefing" was actually a several hour conversation with French Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Bertrand Besancenot, who then shared his notes with his European colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="12">Whether Bandar intended to leak his remarks to the media is unclear but the Saudis haven't done anything to wind back his message.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last week, former intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal made many of the same points in an address to the annual Arab-U.S. Policymakers Conference in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is hard to judge the significance of Prince Turki's remarks, because he was essentially fired as ambassador to Washington in 2007 after falling out with King Abdullah.</seg>
<seg id="15">With a nod toward candor, he made it clear he doesn't have a role in the Saudi government and claimed not to be privy to its official deliberations.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, given his apparent place on the kingdom's limited bench of officials that can explain its stances to the world, Prince Turki's remarks can't be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="17">As he put it, Saudi Arabia "is a peninsula, not an island."</seg>
<seg id="18">This is far from the first crisis the U.S.-Saudi alliance has experienced.</seg>
<seg id="19">In early 1939, a Saudi delegation went to Nazi Germany to negotiate an arms agreement, part of which would have been diverted to Palestinian Arabs fighting Jewish immigrants in the British mandate of Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="20">At least some of the Saudi group met Adolf Hitler at his mountain top hideaway at Berchtesgaden.</seg>
<seg id="21">German arms never reached the kingdom -- or Palestine - as the Saudis could not afford to consummate the deal (that was in the days before the oil revenues started flowing in).</seg>
<seg id="22">However, King Abdullah still treasures a dagger given as a gift from the Fuhrer himself, and occasionally shows it off to guests.</seg>
<seg id="23">Visiting U.S. officials are briefed in advance so they can display appropriate diplomatic sang-froid if Abdullah points out the memento.</seg>
<seg id="24">But despite the multitude of crises -- from the 9/11 hijackers to Saudi pay-offs to Osama bin Laden -- past difficulties have been quietly repaired.</seg>
<seg id="25">The operative word here is "quietly" -- usually, the general public has not even known of the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="26">The difference now is that, through Saudi Arabia's move at the United Nations and Bandar's briefing, the kingdom is all but trumpeting its displeasure.</seg>
<seg id="27">Assuming that the Saudi-U.S. relationship is really heading off course, what could go wrong this time?</seg>
<seg id="28">Here are seven nightmare scenarios that should keep officials in the State Department and Pentagon up at night.</seg>
<seg id="29">Saudi Arabia uses the oil weapon.</seg>
<seg id="30">The kingdom could cut back its production, which has been boosted to over 10 million barrels/day at Washington's request, to make up for the fall in Iranian exports caused by sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="31">Riyadh enjoys the revenues generated by higher production, but price hikes caused by tightening supply could more than compensate the kingdom.</seg>
<seg id="32">Meanwhile, a drop in supply will cause the price at the gas pump to spike in the United States -- endangering the economic recovery and having an almost immediate impact on domestic public opinion.</seg>
<seg id="33">Saudi Arabia reaches out to Pakistan for nuclear-tipped missiles.</seg>
<seg id="34">Riyadh has long had an interest in Islamabad's nuclear program: The kingdom allegedly partially funded Pakistan's pursuit of a nuclear weapon.</seg>
<seg id="35">In 1999, then Saudi Defense Minister Prince Sultan was welcomed by Pakistani Premier Nawaz Sharif to the Kahuta plant, where Pakistan produces highly enriched uranium.</seg>
<seg id="36">After being overthrown by the military later the same year, Sharif is now back again as prime minister -- after spending years in exile in Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg id="37">While Islamabad would not want to get in between Riyadh and Tehran, the arrangement could be financially lucrative.</seg>
<seg id="38">It would also help Pakistan out-flank India: If part of Islamabad's nuclear arsenal was in the kingdom, it would effectively make it immune from Indian attack.</seg>
<seg id="39">Alternatively, the kingdom could declare the intention of building a uranium enrichment plant to match Iranian nuclear ambitions -- to which, in Riyadh's view, Washington appears to be acquiescing.</seg>
<seg id="40">As King Abdullah told senior U.S. diplomat Dennis Ross in April 2009, "If they get nuclear weapons, we will get nuclear weapons."</seg>
<seg id="41">Riyadh helps kick the United States out of Bahrain.</seg>
<seg id="42">When Bahrain was rocked by protests in 2011, Saudi Arabia led an intervention by Gulf states to reinforce the royal family's grip on the throne.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Saudis have the leverage, therefore, to encourage Bahrain to force the U.S. Navy Fifth Fleet to leave its headquarters in Manama, from which the United States projects power across the Persian Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="44">It wouldn't be a hard sell: Hardline Bahraini royals are already fed up with American criticism of their domestic crackdown on Shiites protesting for more rights.</seg>
<seg id="45">But it would be a hard landing for U.S. power projection in the Middle East: The current arrangements for the Fifth Fleet would be hard to reproduce in any other Gulf sheikhdom.</seg>
<seg id="46">And it's not without some precedent.</seg>
<seg id="47">Riyadh forced the United States out of its own Prince Sultan air base 10 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="48">The kingdom supplies new and dangerous weaponry to the Syrian rebels.</seg>
<seg id="49">The Saudis are already expanding their intervention against President Bashar al-Assad's regime, funneling money and arms to hardline Salafist groups across Syria.</seg>
<seg id="50">But they have so far heeded U.S. warnings not to supply the rebels with certain weapons -- most notably portable surface-to-air missile systems, which could not only bring down Assad's warplanes but also civilian airliners.</seg>
<seg id="51">Saudi Arabia could potentially end its ban on sending rebel groups these weapons systems -- and obscure the origins of the missiles, to avoid direct blame for any of the havoc they cause.</seg>
<seg id="52">The Saudis support a new intifada in the Palestinian territories.</seg>
<seg id="53">Riyadh has long been vocal about its frustrations with the lack of progress on an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal.</seg>
<seg id="54">Palestine was the top reason given in the official Saudi statement rejecting the U.N. Security Council seat.</seg>
<seg id="55">The issue is also close to Abdullah's heart -- in 2001, he declined an invitation to Washington due to lack of U.S. pressure on Israel.</seg>
<seg id="56">What's more, Riyadh knows that playing the "Arab" card would be popular at home and across the region.</seg>
<seg id="57">If Saudi Arabia truly feels that the prospect for a negotiated settlement is irreparably stalled, it could quietly empower violent forces in the West Bank that could launch attacks against Israeli forces and settlers -- fatally wounding the current mediation efforts led by Secretary of State John Kerry.</seg>
<seg id="58">Riyadh boosts the military-led regime in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="59">The House of Saud has already turned into one of Egypt's primary patrons, pledging $5 billion in assistance immediately after the military toppled former President Mohamed Morsy.</seg>
<seg id="60">Such support has allowed Egypt's new rulers to ignore Washington's threats that it would cut off aid due to the government's violent crackdown on protesters.</seg>
<seg id="61">By deepening its support, Saudi Arabia could further undermine Washington's attempt to steer Cairo back toward democratic rule.</seg>
<seg id="62">As Cairo moves toward a referendum over a new constitution, as well as parliamentary and presidential elections, Gulf support could convince the generals to rig the votes against the Muslim Brotherhood, and violently crush any opposition to their rule.</seg>
<seg id="63">Saudi Arabia presses for an "Islamic seat" on the U.N. Security Council.</seg>
<seg id="64">The kingdom has long voiced its discontent for the way power is doled out in the world's most important security body.</seg>
<seg id="65">The leaders of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, a bloc of 57 member states designed to represent Muslim issues in global affairs, has called for such an "Islamic seat."</seg>
<seg id="66">The United States and other veto-wielding countries, of course, can be counted on to oppose any effort that would diminish their power in the Security Council.</seg>
<seg id="67">But even if the Saudi plan fails, the kingdom could depict U.S. opposition as anti-Islamic.</seg>
<seg id="68">Such an effort would wreck America's image in the Middle East, and provide dangerous fodder for Sunni extremists already hostile to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="69">Washington insiders will no doubt see any of these potential Saudi policies as self-defeating.</seg>
<seg id="70">However, it would be a mistake to ignore Riyadh's frustration: While Washington thinks it can call the Saudis' bluff, top officials in the kingdom also appear to believe that the United States is bluffing about its commitment to a range of decisions antagonistic to Saudi interests.</seg>
<seg id="71">The big difference is that the tension in the relationship is the No.</seg>

<seg id="1">RBS boss admits small firms failings as split looms</seg>
<seg id="2">ROYAL Bank of Scotland's new boss has pledged a raft of actions to boost its support for smaller businesses after an independent report out today claims the bank has failed to meet the expectations of its customers.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ross McEwan said he fully accepted the sometimes "uncomfortable" findings of City grandee, Sir Andrew Large, who was commissioned by the bank last July amid mounting criticism of RBS's performance for small and medium-sized companies (SMEs).</seg>
<seg id="4">It comes as a separate Treasury-commissioned independent report is set to recommend today that RBS's toxic loans be ringfenced in an internal "bad bank."</seg>
<seg id="5">It expects this to free up an internal "good bank" to boost lending to businesses.</seg>
<seg id="6">In response to today's Large report, RBS promises to write to thousands more businesses telling them how much more the bank is willing to lend.</seg>
<seg id="7">It also plans to sharply cut the time that SME loan applications take and work on a new survey with business groups such as the Federation of Small Businesses to judge how well the bank serves the sector.</seg>
<seg id="8">McEwan, who replaced Stephen Hester as chief executive last month, also unveils RBS's third-quarter trading results this morning.</seg>
<seg id="9">He is set to claim the bank's acceptance of Large's criticisms and response shows its determination to confront its failings in SME lending.</seg>
<seg id="10">The report says RBS has already made a number of "critical changes" to its SME business since the onset of the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, the report, also involving management consultants Oliver Wyman, also concludes the bank "has not supported the SME sector in a way that meets its own targets or the expectations of its customers."</seg>
<seg id="12">It says that, while RBS has "started to address a number of the issues raised, further progress is needed."</seg>
<seg id="13">McEwan said: "The picture Sir Andrew Large paints is not an entirely comfortable one, but it's one we have to confront."</seg>
<seg id="14">A successful, vibrant, and well-regarded SME bank is central to the overall value and reputation of this company.</seg>
<seg id="15">He added that the review "shows that there is significantly more we can do to expand our lending to small and medium-sized businesses."</seg>
<seg id="16">More recently, some of our competitors have managed to increase their lending in this area while we continue to contract.</seg>
<seg id="17">We will address all the issues this report raises.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS said today that in future it will aim for "all but the most complex lending decisions to be made in just five days of receipt of all necessary information."</seg>
<seg id="19">The process, it admitted, can currently take weeks or months.</seg>
<seg id="20">The bank will set up a dedicated website to show what information it uses to make an SME lending decision.</seg>
<seg id="21">RBS said it will aim for two thirds of its lending decisions to be made locally and by sector specialists.</seg>
<seg id="22">And it aims to target at least 90 per cent of its relationship managers and credit managers being professionally qualified by end-2014.</seg>
<seg id="23">Colin Borland, a spokesman for the Scottish Federation of Small Businesses, said: "This report looks a positive step in RBS proactively asking its customers what they need from the bank."</seg>
<seg id="24">It does not look like a whitewash.</seg>
<seg id="25">McEwan's comments and promised actions suggest it is being taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="26">It looks like he is accepting RBS has to do better.</seg>

<seg id="1">Egypt swears in first freely elected president</seg>
<seg id="2">Mohamed Morsi takes the oath of office but his day of triumph is unlikely to mark end of political strife in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="3">ISLAMIST Mohamed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" as he took the oath of office to become the country's first freely elected president, succeeding Hosni Mubarak who was ousted 16 months ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the Arab world's first freely elected Islamist president and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="5">He took the oath before the court's 18 black-robed judges in its Nile-side seat built to resemble an ancient Egyptian temple.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We aspire to a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said during a solemn ceremony shown live on state television.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundation of a new life - absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability," said Morsi, a 60-year-old US-trained engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has spent most of the 84 years since its inception as an outlawed organisation harshly targeted by successive governments.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building as Morsi arrived shortly after 11am local time in a small motorcade.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only several hundred supporters gathered outside the court to cheer the new president and, in a departure from the presidential pomp of the Mubarak years, traffic was only briefly halted to allow his motorcade through on the usually busy road linking the city centre with its southern suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="10">Derided as the Brotherhood's uncharismatic "spare tyre," his personal prestige has surged since his victory and his delivery of a Friday speech that tried to present him as a candidate not just of Islamists but of all those who want to complete the work of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Morsi, wearing a blue business suit and a red tie, told the judges in the wood-panelled chamber where he took the oath of office.</seg>
<seg id="12">Morsi later travelled to Cairo University where he was to make his inauguration address.</seg>
<seg id="13">He was given an official welcome by an army band that played the national anthem as he stood to attention.</seg>
<seg id="14">Military ruler Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was in attendance.</seg>
<seg id="15">His arrival was greeted with chants of, "The army and the people are one hand," from the hundreds gathered in the university's main lecture room.</seg>
<seg id="16">Established in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="17">Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, birthplace of the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers stripped from his office by the military council that took over from the ousted leader.</seg>
<seg id="18">But by agreeing to take the official oath before the court, rather than before parliament as is customary, he is bowing to the military's will in an indication that the contest for power will continue.</seg>
<seg id="19">Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was filled with dramatic populist gestures.</seg>

<seg id="2">(UPI) -- A Georgia school bus driver liked one of her 12-year-old passengers so much that she decided to keep her instead of dropping her at the bus stop.</seg>
<seg id="3">Cheryl Rodgers was at home on Tuesday afternoon when her 13-year-old daughter walked into the house and informed her that her little sister was still on the school bus and that the driver wanted to speak with her.</seg>
<seg id="4">When Rodgers went outside, the bus had already driven off.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I look, and the bus is gone," she said."</seg>
<seg id="6">Fearing the worst, Rodgers hopped in her car to chase the bus and called 911.</seg>
<seg id="7">""I'm sure I was in a frenzy, but I told them, I said, 'I believe my daughter's just been kidnapped.'</seg>
<seg id="8">And that's really, honestly, how I felt.""</seg>
<seg id="9">A deputy stopped the bus two miles from the Rodgers home, well off of its route.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Sheriff's Office identified Jennifer Cornelia Foster, 50, as the driver.</seg>
<seg id="11">""I'm not even sure where the bus was going, and why she was so far off-route," Rodgers said."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Rodgers" daughter and the other children on board were fine."</seg>
<seg id="13">""You don't just take someone's child, and take 'em wherever you want," Rodgers said.</seg>
<seg id="14">It was just bizarre.</seg>
<seg id="15">She said Foster was full of excuses.</seg>
<seg id="16">"She just proceeded to tell one story after the next, and none of them made any sense," Rodgers said.</seg>
<seg id="17">One was that she may have alluded to knowing me personally, like it was just mis-communication.</seg>
<seg id="18">One was, 'We were dropping her off at her grandmother's house,' and I said, 'My parents actually live with me.'</seg>
<seg id="19">Rodgers wants criminal charges filed against Foster.</seg>
<seg id="20">Although it's unclear whether that will happen, the Rockdale County School System has suspended Foster while the incident is under investigation.</seg>

<seg id="2">A tunnel linking warehouses in Tijuana and San Diego was used to smuggle drugs across the US/Mexican border.</seg>
<seg id="3">US and Mexican authorities have unearthed another sophisticated "supertunnel" used to smuggle drugs beneath their common border, the third since 2011, officials say.</seg>
<seg id="4">Zig-zagging for a third of a mile beneath the border between San Diego and Tijuana, the newly-constructed tunnel was equipped with an electric-powered rail system to carry the drugs, as well as ventilation.</seg>
<seg id="5">The tunnel is equipped with electricity, ventilation and a rail system.</seg>
<seg id="6">For the first time, agents seized cocaine intended to be smuggled through the tunnel as well as more than eight tonnes of marijuana, indicating that Mexican drug cartels are getting increasingly "desperate," they said.</seg>
<seg id="7">"These cartels are foolish to think they're shovelling under the radar," said US Attorney for Southern California Laura Duffy at a press conference outside the San Diego warehouse where the US end of the tunnel was found Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">US Immigration and Customs Enforcement shows agents with bales of some of more than eight tons of marijuana and cocaine seized from the tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="9">Investigators released video footage of the tunnel, which they stressed was uncovered before it had been used.</seg>
<seg id="10">In a message to drug smugglers including notably Mexico's Sinaloa cartel, Duffy vowed: "If you continue to build and attempt to use these tunnels, we are determined to make this a big waste of your dirty money."</seg>
<seg id="11">United States Attorney for the Southern District of California Laura Duffy, right, and an assistant at the business where authorities found the tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="12">The tunnel was discovered just south of the Otay Mesa border crossing in a business park area.</seg>
<seg id="13">Three people were arrested and authorities seized the huge marijuana haul as well as 147 kilograms of cocaine, which is usually transported in smaller quantities and does not come through tunnels.</seg>
<seg id="14">Their traditional routes are failing at this point.</seg>
<seg id="15">They're very desperate.</seg>
<seg id="16">"They'll do anything they can to get into the US," said Bill Sherman, head of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) 's San Diego office.</seg>

<seg id="18">Agents inspect some of more than eight tons of marijuana and cocaine seized from a tunnel designed to smuggle drugs from Tijuana, Mexico, to San Diego.</seg>
<seg id="19">Law enforcement authorities were increasingly seeing attempts to bring narcotics including cocaine and methamphetamines over the border through tunnels, or microlight aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Those are acts of desperation," Sherman said.</seg>
<seg id="21">Construction of the tunnel likely took a year or more and had an average depth of 10.5 metres, officials said, adding that it was the work of "engineers and architects."</seg>
<seg id="22">Agents in the tunnel which was well designed with electricity, ventilation and a rail system.</seg>
<seg id="23">It included hydraulically-controlled steel doors.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the three arrested, two were detained in connection with the cocaine seized, and one, a Mexican national, was held over the marijuana haul.</seg>
<seg id="25">All face a maximum of 10 years to life in jail, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Tijuana, a Mexican security source said the tunnel was accessed at the southern end by a metal stairway.</seg>

<seg id="3">On Wednesday evening around 5:20 p.m., a man entered Tindall Diamonds & Jewelry in Robbinsville, N.J., and asked to see some loose diamonds, store owner Robert Tindall told ABCNews.com.</seg>

<seg id="1">Attempting to slow warming artificially could reduce vital rainfall</seg>
<seg id="2">31 (UPI) -- Attempts to geoengineer the climate to reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could reduce vital rains in some parts of the world, U.S. scientists say.</seg>
<seg id="3">A technological approach to reducing future global warming could also interfere with rainfall and snowfall, an international study led by scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., found.</seg>
<seg id="4">Global warming caused by a massive increases in greenhouse gases could spur a nearly 7 percent average increase in precipitation compared to preindustrial conditions, the scientists said, but trying to resolve the problem through geoengineering could result in vital monsoonal rains in North America, East Asia and other regions dropping by 5-7 percent compared to preindustrial conditions, and average precipitation could decrease by about 4.5 percent globally, they said.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Geoengineering the planet doesn't cure the problem," NCAR scientist Simone Tilmes, the study's lead author, said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Even if one of these techniques could keep global temperatures approximately balanced, precipitation would not return to preindustrial conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some proposed geoengineering approaches to reduce future warming would capture carbon dioxide before it enters the atmosphere, while others would attempt to shade the atmosphere by injecting sulfate particles into the stratosphere or launching mirrors into orbit with the goal of reducing global surface temperatures.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It's very much a pick-your-poison type of problem," NCAR scientist and study co-author John Fasullo said.</seg>
<seg id="9">If you don't like warming, you can reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the surface and cool the climate.</seg>

<seg id="2">Digital operations are also performing strongly, it added.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Lie will be filmed in Dublin and co-produced by STV, Irish commercial broadcaster TV3 and GroupM Entertainment, which has partnered with STV on a number of projects since the two first came together in 2012 to make psychological thriller The Poison Tree.</seg>
<seg id="4">The quiz show will feature two teams of contestants competing for a cash prize by identifying the one lie from a list of otherwise true statements.</seg>
<seg id="5">Ten episodes will be made for TV3 and six will be aired in Scotland, with the latter fronted by comedian Susan Calman.</seg>
<seg id="6">STV chief executive Rob Woodward said the commission for The Lie demonstrated the group's growing credentials in entertainment programming, a key feature in the company's quest to expand its revenues from activities other than broadcasting.</seg>
<seg id="7">Director of content Alan Clements said the project would build upon other entertainment programming from STV Productions such as Catchphrase, and the second series of Fake Reaction, due to air on ITV2 next year.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It is fantastic to be bringing this new format to peak time audiences on STV and TV3," Clements said.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is the first opportunity we have had to work with TV3 and we are looking forward to filming starting in Ireland before the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">Turning to the group financial figures for the three months to the end of October, Woodward said trading remained in line with forecasts.</seg>
<seg id="11">National advertising revenues were up 6 per cent during the third quarter, and are expected to remain ahead of the market through November with a rise of about 5 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="12">Regional airtime revenues, meanwhile, were 4 per cent higher during the third quarter, and are expected to be 5 per cent up through to the end of November.</seg>
<seg id="13">STV's digital business is expected to show growth of 21 per cent through to the end of this month.</seg>

<seg id="3">Routine tests revealed that products processed in Romania in January and sold by shops of the Home Bargains and Quality Save chains contained between 1 and 5% of horse DNA.</seg>

<seg id="1">Aircraft electronic device rules to stay in force in Australia for now</seg>
<seg id="2">Australian airline passengers will need to continue turning off their tablets and smart phones during take-off and landing despite moves in the US to loosen regulations covering the devices.</seg>
<seg id="3">The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the way open for American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight provided they remain in "airplane" mode.</seg>
<seg id="4">Passengers can already do this during the bulk of a flight but many people find it annoying to be unable to access their e-books during take-offs and landings.</seg>
<seg id="5">Australian carriers are looking at the decision, which requires US carriers to undertake a massive amount of work to meet the requirements, but have indicated they have no immediate plans to change their procedures.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was looking at the announcement but emphasised that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight were still in place in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="7">"CASA currently has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft," it said.</seg>
<seg id="8">The issue is covered by regulations which require aircraft operators to ensure safety is maintained at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members.</seg>
<seg id="9">Virgin, which has already been talking to CASA about extending the use its in-flight wi-fi entertainment system, was amenable to a change but said it would take its lead from the regulator.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We would welcome a review by CASA into allowing the use of electronic devices because we really do think it will improve the customer experience now that we have (wireless in-flight entertainment) on our planes," a spokesman said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Qantas said it would stick with the current rules for now.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing and we have no immediate plans to change that," it said.</seg>
<seg id="13">The FAA ruling applies to American airlines.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, we are always interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers and we will certainly be taking a close look at the FAA's decision and the reasons behind it.</seg>
<seg id="15">For US carriers, the impact of the ruling will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.</seg>
<seg id="16">Carriers will need to prove their planes can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices as well as revise manuals, training materials, carry-on baggage programs and passenger briefings.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Once an airline verifies the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use handheld, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-readers, and smartphones-at all altitudes," the FAA said.</seg>
<seg id="18">In rare instances of low visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during landing.</seg>
<seg id="19">The group also recommended that heavier devices should be safely stowed under seats or in overhead bins during take-off and landing.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pain lingers in Tasmanian Budget</seg>
<seg id="2">Tasmanian Premier Lara Giddings.</seg>
<seg id="3">Source: The Mercury</seg>
<seg id="4">THE first cut has proved the deepest for Tasmanian Premier and Treasurer Lara Giddings, but the pain will linger after tax rises and more cuts to the public service were announced in the State's Budget.</seg>
<seg id="5">Ms Giddings says she has produced a responsible Budget with "heart," quarantining health, education and police after $1.4 billion was cut from her first Budget last year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Householders will receive relief from power price increases to the tune of $300 million over the next four years, while some of the proceeds of the recent sale of the state's TOTE will be used to help the needy.</seg>
<seg id="7">Other government departments, however, will be forced to find $68 million in savings over the next four years, while state taxes will go up by $39 million as Tasmania deals with falling GST revenue in conditions Ms Giddings is calling the worst since the 1930s.</seg>
<seg id="8">"While we cannot afford to abandon fiscal discipline, this Budget also has a heart," Ms Giddings said.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Premier faced a furious backlash over last year's cuts and Senior Minister David O'Byrne was forced to rule out a leadership challenge in December.</seg>
<seg id="10">But Ms Giddings said her approach this time was about balance and not a response to those pressures.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I believe Tasmanians think we've gone hard enough when they look at their hospital system, when they look at the pressures in education and across police," she said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Or we could have gone softer ... which would plunge us deeper into a problem that would take longer to get out of.</seg>
<seg id="13">As flagged in her mid-year financial report in February, the state's deficit is more than double the forecast in last year's budget at $289 million, while in 2012/13 it is predicted to be $283 million.</seg>
<seg id="14">A $114 million drop in GST receipts was the main culprit, Ms Giddings said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Net debt is forecast to peak at $134 million in 2012/13 but will be eliminated by 2014/15, she said.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Budget is forecast to return to a surplus of about $50 million in 2013/14 on the back of growth in revenue from the GST and carbon tax benefits from Tasmania's large renewable energy sector.</seg>
<seg id="17">Raising eyebrows is $110 million over four years to prop up the ailing Forestry Tasmania.</seg>
<seg id="18">The agency's role and structure are being reviewed amid poor market conditions for forest products and continuing negotiations about conservation areas.</seg>
<seg id="19">"To try to ignore what's happening in the forest industry today is a problem for not just those businesses but also government and that's reflected in this Budget," Ms Giddings said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Opposition Leader Will Hodgman said the Premier had caved in to power-sharing partners the Greens.</seg>
<seg id="21">"It's clearly a Green-Labor Budget," he told ABC Radio.</seg>
<seg id="22">It's taking the state into net debt which is something the Premier promised would never happen under her.</seg>
<seg id="23">Greens Leader Nick McKim said his Budget would have looked different but praised the balance in Ms Giddings' Budget.</seg>
<seg id="24">"This Budget does seek to look after those doing it tough, and implement progressive policy reforms, while still continuing with the necessary financial structural reform," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Charles-de-Gaulle Aircraft Carrier "Unavailable"</seg>
<seg id="2">The aircraft carrier has been left high and dry in Toulon.</seg>
<seg id="3">A leak of radioactive steam, detected on one of the two nuclear stokeholds on the Charles-de-Gaulle in mid-October when the ship was at sea, "posed no threat to the sailors", but is no small matter for the Navy.</seg>
<seg id="4">"La Royale" - the French Navy - has just conformed that the ship will be "unavailable until mid-November" to allow "time to carry out the corrective measures required" on the reactor.</seg>
<seg id="5">Specialist naval defence company DCNS has confirmed that its teams, along with Areva's, have been dispatched to the department of Var and are "currently working on aircraft carrier".</seg>
<seg id="6">Their tasks include changing a pump on the faulty stokehold.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Everything has been put in place to enable the Charles-de-Gaulle to be deployed as planned at the end of 2013," explains DCNS.</seg>
<seg id="8">And the Navy assures that "this has in no way delayed the [nuclear-powered] ship's activity schedule".</seg>
<seg id="9">It should be recalled that the Charles-de-Gaulle had just returned from a six-month period of interim maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="10">It had cast off from Toulon in mid-October for a training exercise,</seg>
<seg id="11">principally for the qualification of new fighter pilots.</seg>
<seg id="12">A "small amount of damage", confined to the area of the reactor chamber, then occurred on the French fleet's flagship.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the Navy, the crew was not exposed to any radioactive contamination.</seg>

<seg id="1">'Blue is the Warmest Color': Can it dent the NC-17 stigma?</seg>
<seg id="2">To say the NC-17 rating has fallen short of its ambitions is like saying the Marquis de Sade might have had a bit of a dirty mind.</seg>
<seg id="3">Launched 23 years ago with high hopes that, as a designation of explicit but sophisticated fare, it could break the porn stigma of the X, the NC-17-soon lost all credibility.</seg>
<seg id="4">These days, studio movies get chopped down so they can wriggle in under the R, or if they're independent films that don't need to be rated, they just go out unrated, as we explored in this story last year.</seg>
<seg id="5">One of the reasons the NC-17 has become so irrelevant is that theaters are extremely reluctant to show movies with the rating.</seg>
<seg id="6">That prompts filmmakers and studios to do anything they can to avoid it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's hard enough to get screens as it is; who wants to appeal to a booker with one strike against them?</seg>
<seg id="8">The biggest (and most principled) opponent in the theater realm has been Cinemark.</seg>
<seg id="9">The country's third-largest chain, based in Plano, Texas, has an official policy against showing any movie rated NC-17.</seg>
<seg id="10">The other chains have various informal policies but nothing written in stone.</seg>
<seg id="11">So it was noteworthy Wednesday when the Patch news site reported that "Blue Is the Warmest Color," the explicit but upscale French lesbian love story that's rated NC-17, would in fact be shown in a Cinemark theater.</seg>
<seg id="12">Bookers for a theater (singular - it was just one, in Evanston, Ill.) were set to play the movie this weekend.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It's strictly a one-theater test that we're trying with this film and this theater," Cinemark marketing manager Frank Gonzales told the site.</seg>
<seg id="14">There's no overall policy change at Cinemarks across the country.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Cinemark policy has always seemed a little silly, if not downright problematic.</seg>
<seg id="16">Any official ban on an entire category of film should stir some discomfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">But it's more than that.</seg>
<seg id="18">Enacting a ban for a rating whose intent was to remove some of the tawdriness associated with any adult-oriented film seems to miss the point.</seg>
<seg id="19">Cinemark wants, presumably, to keep hard-core material out of its theaters.</seg>
<seg id="20">But by banning NC-17 movies outright instead of making a more flexible, case-by-case determination, it doesn't keep out inappropriate material.</seg>
<seg id="21">It just ensures that a lot of inappropriate material gets slightly less inappropriate and jammed in as a very hard R, a movie rating Cinemark of course regularly shows.</seg>
<seg id="22">And because an R is a lot easier to get into than an NC-17 - hello, older brother - the amount of inappropriate content that actually passes in front of the eyes of children is in fact higher than if there were a legitimate adult rating that would allow all those hard Rs to bump up to an NC-17, which theaters like Cinemark could then cordon off and monitor as needed..</seg>
<seg id="23">It's not clear exactly what the "test" is with "Blue.""</seg>
<seg id="24">Is it to see if there are mass protests?</seg>
<seg id="25">It's hard to imagine that large groups of people, in this age of readily available explicitness on the Internet and elsewhere, will get in a lather about one French-language upscale drama playing on one screen.</seg>
<seg id="26">Or is it to see whether the movie does well?</seg>
<seg id="27">If that's the case, then, well, what was the NC-17 ban for in the first place?</seg>
<seg id="28">We have a ban, but if a film is popular, well, so much for that.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Times reached out to a Cinemark spokesman, but a call wasn't returned.</seg>
<seg id="30">Even with all this, the news is encouraging.</seg>
<seg id="31">The most basic conclusion is that it shows a (slight) loosening in standards for a conservative movie chain.</seg>
<seg id="32">But maybe more important is the effect moves like this could have on the rating itself.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Blue Is the Warmest Color" is exactly the kind of film that proponents of a more legitimate adult designation argue there need to be more of.</seg>
<seg id="34">It's won the Palme d'Or, scores of critical raves and the endorsement of Steven Spielberg.</seg>
<seg id="35">IFC, which is releasing the movie, could have gone unrated.</seg>
<seg id="36">But it went (for reasons of courage or marketing), with the NC-17.</seg>
<seg id="37">At its own theater in New York, incidentally, it said it would not enforce the rating, its own little shot across the bows at the NC-17 and the MPAA.</seg>
<seg id="38">By releasing it this way, the company might finally make a small dent in the NC-17 stigma, showing theaters and consumers that an NC-17 doesn't mean a movie is automatically a bottom-feeding porn extravaganza, but could also be a complex, interesting drama that also has some strong sexual situations.</seg>
<seg id="39">In explaining the move to Patch, Gonzales said he couldn't explain exactly why the exception was being made.</seg>
<seg id="40">"It just happens to be the right movie at the right time," he said.</seg>
<seg id="41">Here's hoping.</seg>

<seg id="2">Officials announced on Thursday 31 October that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitten in Val-d'Oise. The kitten must have come from abroad as France has not had any native cases of the disease since 2001.</seg>
<seg id="3">The kitten was found in Argenteuil on 25 October and died on 28 October.</seg>
<seg id="4">The diagnosis of rabies was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.</seg>
<seg id="5">"An epidemiological inquiry was initiated to identify and treat any individuals who may have come into contact with the kitten between 08 to 28 October inclusive," say the Ministries of Health and Agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Five people who had been in contact with the kitten have already been identified," and have received preventive treatment.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Preventive treatment for human rabies administered after contact with the carrier animal but before symptoms appear is very effective," the press release specifies.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ministries are currently asking anyone who might have been bitten, clawed, scratched or licked on a mucous membrane or on damaged skin by the kitten, or who own an animal that may have been in contact with the kitten between 08 to 28 October, to contact them on 08 11 00 06 95 between 10am and 6pm from 01 November.</seg>
<seg id="9">"France has been clear of rabies since 2001. This kitten or the mother were imported from another country where it is still present," says the press release.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last recorded 'native' case of rabies was in December 1998 in a fox and that "France was officially declared free of this disease by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) in November 2001."</seg>
<seg id="11">A case of rabies in a bitch illegally imported from the Gambia was recorded in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Rabies is a fatal disease if not treated promptly," the ministries reminded, and it can be transmitted during the fortnight or so before the first symptoms of the disease appear.</seg>

<seg id="2">Cory Booker took off his hat as mayor of Newark, N.J., and officially became a U.S. Senator today.</seg>
<seg id="3">Booker, well known for his heroic antics and affinity for Twitter, was sworn in by Vice President Joe Biden Thursday afternoon after winning a special election to fill the seat of former Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., who passed away this summer.</seg>
<seg id="4">In typical Booker fashion, the former Newark Mayor tweeted in the lead up to his swearing-in.</seg>
<seg id="5">And Booker got right to work.</seg>
<seg id="6">Immediately after taking the oath as a senator, Booker cast votes in favor of invoking cloture on two controversial nominees - Mel Watt to be the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency and Patricia Millett to be the U.S. Circuit Judge for the District of Columbia Circuit.</seg>
<seg id="7">Republicans ultimately filibustered each of the nominations, which failed to move on.</seg>
<seg id="8">Booker's entry in the Senate increases the Democrat's control to 55-45.</seg>
<seg id="9">Following the death of Lautenberg, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie appointed long-time friend and former N.J. Attorney General Jeffrey Chiesa, a Republican, to fill the vacancy.</seg>

<seg id="11">Thursday afternoon, Booker, who is now one of two African Americans in the U.S. Senate, met privately with President Obama at the White House.</seg>

<seg id="1">Congolese Army Hunts Down M23 Rebels</seg>
<seg id="2">The Congolese army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units would be hunting down M23 rebels right up to their bases located in the forests and mountains of North Kivu, which borders Rwanda and Uganda.</seg>
<seg id="3">The M23 appears to be on the verge of defeat, having been driven out of the towns in the northeast of the Democratic Republic of Congo (RDC), which it had been in control of since the start of the uprising 20 months ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We will pursue the M23 and drive it out of wherever it is hiding because they are criminals," Colonel Olivier Hamuli, spokesman for the FARDC, declared to Reuters.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We must not allow them to regroup because they have been making the Congolese people suffer for too long.</seg>
<seg id="6">The time has come for peace to be restored."</seg>
<seg id="7">Leaders of the M23 say they evacuated the towns under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bisimwa, political leader of the rebellion, asserted on RFI that these military setbacks would not change its demands at the peace talks in any way.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the Ugandan mediators,talks between the government in Kinshasa and the M23 resumed in Kampala on Wednesday,.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skirmishes were reported in the hills above Bunagana, the last town in the hands of the rebels to fall this week, and around Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion started in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="10">At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the capital of the province of North Kivu, taking advantage of the retreat of the government garrison and the inaction of the Monusco blue berets.</seg>
<seg id="11">The fall of Goma led the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the largest in the world in terms of numbers, to reinforce its mandate and form a rapid intervention force consisting of soldiers from South Africa, Malawi and Tanzania.</seg>
<seg id="12">Meanwhile, FARDC staff has been reshuffled and the army has gone on the offensive against the M23, changing the course of the war.</seg>
<seg id="13">The rate of progress of the government troops today is unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="14">"The M23 seems to be nearing its end," predicted an expert in Congolese affairs, Jason Stearns, on his blog Congo Siasa.</seg>
<seg id="15">This would be historic - it would be the first time that the government in Kinshasa has succeeded in quashing a major insurrection.</seg>
<seg id="16">And it would also be the first time since 1996 that there is no armed group allied to Rwanda present in the east of the RDC.</seg>
<seg id="17">United Nations experts accuse Rwanda of providing military support to the M23, which has initially made up of mutinous former Congolese soldiers. Rwanda vehemently denies this.</seg>
<seg id="18">The British Foreign Secretary, William Hague, called on the Rwandan President Paul Kagame to show restraint, a Foreign Office spokesman announced.</seg>
<seg id="19">Last week, Kigali raised the possibility of military retaliation after shells landed in Rwandan territory.</seg>
<seg id="20">On Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana took to the streets of the town to welcome the entry of the FARDC troops.</seg>
<seg id="21">"We have been living with the M23 for a year and it seemed unimaginable that we would one day be freed by the army," said an inhabitant of the town on the border with Uganda.</seg>
<seg id="22">"We have been living in terror [of the M23], we are traumatised," the man added.</seg>

<seg id="1">Investigation on Mayor Rob Ford Botched, Lawyer Maintains</seg>
<seg id="2">After the police confirmed that they laid hands on a copy of a video allegedly showing Rob Ford smoking crack, Barrister Clayton Ruby maintained that he has never seen an investigation "so botched".</seg>
<seg id="3">The barrister said to the Canadian Press that he believes the police had "ignored or downplayed" evidence against the mayor.</seg>
<seg id="4">This Thursday, police arrested Rob Ford's friend and occasional chauffeur, Alexander Lisi, aged 35, and charged him with extortion in relation with the video.</seg>
<seg id="5">Lisi, who has previously been accused of drug trafficking, was frequently in contact with the mayor.</seg>
<seg id="6">The police said they have also observed him delivering parcels to Rob Ford, according to new court documents.</seg>
<seg id="7">Ruby says it is "inexplicable" that the police have never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or home, or tapped his telephone, saying that chief of police Bill Blair knowingly decided not to act against the mayor.</seg>
<seg id="8">In accordance with the law, the police, having themselves witnessed suspicious transactions, could have intercepted Ford's vehicle, arrested the mayor and carried out a search - even without a warrant.</seg>
<seg id="9">They could also have requested an immediate search warrant, if this was considered necessary.</seg>
<seg id="10">The chief of police has not commented. However, his spokesman, Mark Pugash, has described Ruby's statements as "an obvious and desperate attempt" to sell himself to the media in a matter that does not concern him at all.</seg>
<seg id="11">In a press conference on Thursday, Mr Blair stated that there was nothing in this video that might constitute a "reasonable motive" that could lead to criminal charges being brought against the mayor.</seg>

<seg id="2">Since the beginning of the academic year, the Sherbrooke Region School Board (CSRS) has been demanding a $150 fee per student (to a maximum of $300 per family) for students using school transport to get to two addresses, a service that the organisation offers when it is able to.</seg>
<seg id="3">No financial contribution had been demanded prior to the changes made to the last budget.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The Board proposed a mediation service and I was interested," says Mrs Lefevre.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to her, the CSRS was invited to a mediation and she asked for an additional period for consideration.</seg>
<seg id="6">"It is always better to discuss, consult and find solutions such issues," Mrs Lefevre believes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Sherbrooke Region School Board (CSRS) did not wish to comment on the issue.</seg>
<seg id="8">The organisation merely indicated that the mediation was part of a process arising from a complaint.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ed Davey sets out energy sector reforms</seg>
<seg id="2">THE UK government today announced a package of energy reforms including the prospect of criminal charges for power company bosses who rig the markets.</seg>
<seg id="3">In an attempt to combat the growing public anger over rising energy prices, the Energy Secretary Ed Davey unveiled a series of measures in an attempt to hand more "control" to consumers who are paying for the rises imposed by the "Big Six" energy companies.</seg>
<seg id="4">The package includes moves to make it easier and quicker for customers to switch suppliers, moving from the current time of around five weeks to just 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr Davey's announcement was an attempt to seize the initiative on the issue from Labour, which has stolen a march on the UK government by pledging to freeze energy prices should Ed Miliband's party win the next general election.</seg>
<seg id="6">The UK government has argued that Labour's approach would simply see energy companies push up prices in anticipation of a freeze, and energy companies have warned that Mr Miliband's proposal could cause blackouts.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Liberal Democrat minister revealed his department will consult on introducing criminal sanctions for anyone manipulating the energy markets.</seg>
<seg id="8">He said the reforms will make it easier for consumers to switch and get the best deal, forcing energy companies to compete more actively for their custom.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Davey told the Commons that energy companies should be more open about how they treat credit balances in consumers" accounts, making every effort to return money to customers who close accounts.</seg>
<seg id="10">Where that is not possible, energy firms should ringfence that money to help the most vulnerable customers.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr Davey also announced that his department will work with the Post Office to direct elderly and vulnerable people to the 500 volunteers being trained by the Big Energy Saving Network to help people find ways to cut their bills.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ofgem will carry out an annual market assessment to monitor the behaviour of market participants and ensure the market is working for residential and small business consumers and that all suppliers can compete fairly, with the first assessment completed by next spring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr Davey added more transparency was needed on how firms reported their finances.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ofgem will also assess energy suppliers" financial reporting practices and set out any steps to improve transparency so that consumers can see where their money is going.</seg>
<seg id="15">This assessment will also report in spring 2014.</seg>
<seg id="16">But his plans were met with a withering response from critics of the price hikes, who said his plan resembled "rearranging deckchairs on the Titanic."</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Davey acted in the same week that high-profile figures working for the Big Six - ScottishPower, British Gas, Npower, E.ON, EDF and SSE - were criticised by MPs on the House of Commons energy and climate change committee.</seg>
<seg id="18">MPs were angered by the rising bills triggered by four of the Big Six, indicating that charges would rise by an average of over 9 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="19">SSE was the first of the major energy firms to announce it was raising gas and electricity bills.</seg>
<seg id="20">Its increase of up to 10 per cent will add a typical £106 to annual dual-fuel customer charges for an average bill of £1,380.</seg>
<seg id="21">British Gas is increasing electricity bills by 10.4 per cent and gas tariffs by 8.4 per cent for around 7.8 million families this winter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Npower will put up electricity and gas prices by 9.3 per cent and 11.1 per cent respectively from 1 December, affecting about 3.1 million customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">ScottishPower will raise gas tariffs by 8.5 per cent and electricity prices by 9 per cent on average from 6 December for its 2.2 million customers.</seg>
<seg id="24">Making his announcement, Mr Davey said: "The energy industry needs to change to put consumers in control."</seg>
<seg id="25">That means making it easy for people to change supplier to save money, it means regular market assessments to check their behaviour, and it means tougher penalties for market manipulation and putting an end to opaque finances.</seg>
<seg id="26">But green campaigners were critical of the idea that switching companies would have an impact when gas prices were rising, while Labour said a price freeze was the way forward.</seg>
<seg id="27">Friends of the Earth energy campaigner Sophie Neuburg said: "Ed Davey is right."</seg>
<seg id="28">Bills are soaring thanks to rising gas prices, but promoting easier switching is like rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic.</seg>
<seg id="29">The real solutions - massive investment in energy efficiency and a rapid switch to renewables - are conspicuous by their absence from the minister's plans.</seg>
<seg id="30">Caroline Flint, shadow energy and climate change secretary, said: "It's another day, another policy that will do nothing to help people with their bills this winter."</seg>
<seg id="31">Hard-pressed energy customers struggling with the cost of living need action now, not endless reviews and consultations from an out-of-touch government that refuses to stand up to the energy companies.</seg>
<seg id="32">What we need now is a price freeze because this is the only way we can deal with the energy companies overcharging.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the Commons, Ms Flint listed her own series of changes she thought the government should make to the energy market, including "putting an end to secret deals and requiring all electricity to be bought and sold via an open exchange."</seg>
<seg id="34">Mr Davey responded by saying that Labour must hand over any evidence it has showing the Big Six energy companies acting as a "cartel" so that the competition regulator could investigate.</seg>
<seg id="35">Ms Flint's Labour colleague Ian Lavery also claimed there was emerging evidence of a "hidden, protected, secret sort of cartel trading scheme" in which energy companies traded with each other at above the wholesale price before passing the increases on to consumers.</seg>
<seg id="36">He asked the Energy Secretary to confirm "hand on heart" he was not aware of anything like this happening, a question Mr Davey did not appear to directly address in his response.</seg>
<seg id="37">Reacting to the government's reform package, Trades Union Congress general secretary Frances O'Grady said: "Households are spending almost twice as much of their income on gas and electricity as they did a decade ago."</seg>
<seg id="38">This is what a living standards crisis looks like.</seg>
<seg id="39">But these proposals will do little to help, and look like the result of a desperate search for something to say rather than action to help household budgets.</seg>
<seg id="40">Key points</seg>
<seg id="41">Energy companies will be told they must make switching suppliers faster for consumers - with an ambition to move to switching in 24 hours, rather than the current five weeks, without increasing consumer bills.</seg>
<seg id="42">The Department of Energy & Climate Change (DECC) will work with the Post Office to signpost elderly and vulnerable people to help them cut bills.</seg>
<seg id="43">Ofgem will carry out a market assessment every year with the Office of Fair Trading and the new Competition and Market Authority to monitor the market.</seg>
<seg id="44">The DECC will consult on introducing criminal sanctions for manipulating the energy markets in the same way as manipulating the financial markets does.</seg>

<seg id="1">Israeli planes strike Syrian military base, U.S. official says</seg>
<seg id="2">By Barbara Starr, CNN Pentagon Correspondent</seg>
<seg id="3">November 1, 2013 -- Updated 0243 GMT (1043 HKT)</seg>
<seg id="4">NEW: The Syrian military regains control of the town of al Safira</seg>
<seg id="5">Israel Defense Forces spokeswoman: "We don't refer to foreign reports"</seg>
<seg id="6">U.S. official: Targeted were missiles, equipment the Israelis felt might be given to Hezbollah</seg>
<seg id="7">Israel has long said it would target any transfer of weapons to Hezbollah</seg>
<seg id="8">(CNN) -- Israeli warplanes struck a military base near the Syrian port city of Latakia this week, an Obama administration official told CNN on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="9">An explosion at a missile storage site in the area was reported in the Middle Eastern press, but an attack has not been confirmed by the Israeli government.</seg>
<seg id="10">The target, according to the Obama administration official, was missiles and related equipment the Israelis felt might be transferred to the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah.</seg>
<seg id="11">The official declined to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the information.</seg>
<seg id="12">There was some confusion about the timing of the attack, with some reports saying it happened Wednesday, and others saying Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">When asked for comment, an Israel Defense Forces spokeswoman told CNN: "We don't refer to foreign reports."</seg>
<seg id="14">Israel has been accused several other times this year of launching airstrikes inside Syria, including once in January.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the January incident, a U.S. official said Israeli fighter jets bombed a Syrian convoy suspected of moving weapons to Hezbollah.</seg>
<seg id="16">Israel's military did not comment on any of the allegations at the time, but has long said it would target any transfer of weapons to Hezbollah or other groups designated as terrorists, as well as any effort to smuggle Syrian weapons into Lebanon that could threaten Israel.</seg>
<seg id="17">Thursday's reports of a blast come amid a Syrian civil war in which Hezbollah, a Shiite Muslim militant group, has been helping Syrian government forces.</seg>
<seg id="18">Syria's government is led by President Bashar al-Assad, a member of the Shiite offshoot Alawite sect; the rebels and other militants fighting al-Assad's forces and Hezbollah are largely made up of Sunni Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Syrian conflict began in March 2011 after government forces cracked down on peaceful protesters during the Arab Spring movement and is now a full-blown civil war.</seg>
<seg id="20">The United Nations estimates that more than 100,000 people have died in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, the Syrian military took back control of al Safira, a town that is believed to house a chemical weapons production facility.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rebels withdrew from the strategic town, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id="23">International inspectors are trying to ensure that Syria eliminates its chemical weapons stockpile by the middle of next year.</seg>
<seg id="24">Syria agreed to the program under international pressure earlier this year.</seg>
<seg id="25">One of the monitoring groups, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, said Thursday that Syria has destroyed all its declared chemical weapons mixing, filling and production facilities, and all of the chemical weapons at inspected sites have been placed under seal.</seg>
<seg id="26">The watchdog body's announcement of the facilities' destruction meant that Syria met a key deadline in the elimination program.</seg>
<seg id="27">The joint United Nations-OPCW mission visited 21 out of 23 sites, an OPCW statement said, and 39 of the 41 facilities at those sites.</seg>
<seg id="28">The remaining two sites were too dangerous for the inspectors to go to, it said, but Syria had declared those sites abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="29">The chemical weapons equipment there was moved to other sites, which were inspected.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the start of this week, a family abandoned its ground floor apartment in building Fructidor D2 because of the presence of rats.</seg>
<seg id="3">In view of the urgency of the situation, the director of the Terres du Sud Habitat office offered to provide exceptional, provisional rehousing for the couple and their three children in a new four-room house.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the family refused "for financial reasons" and the situation is at stalemate.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The matter has become exaggerated," thinks Joël Canapa, office director.</seg>
<seg id="6">"There have always been rats in towns.</seg>
<seg id="7">The rat extermination company conducts two operations per year. Furthermore, we intervene at our own cost whenever there is a complaint from residents.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hence we have carried out 64 operations since last winter.</seg>
<seg id="9">The area has not been abandoned and rats are not swarming into the town.</seg>
<seg id="10">Due to environmental protection and public health concerns, rat extermination products are four times less efficient than in the past, but we are not going to kill a kid for the sake of two rats."</seg>
<seg id="11">"We didn't invite the rats in," counters the father of the family, which left its home and moved into a hotel.</seg>

<seg id="2">A former vice-governor of the province of Jilin, in the northeast of China, sentenced to life imprisonment for corruption on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Having been expelled from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of receiving 19 million yuan in bribes, according to media officials in China.</seg>
<seg id="4">Between 1995 and 2001, the vice-governor, who was also president of the Bank of Jilin, a public institution, helped businesses and managers win contracts, loans and promotions in exchange for money or gifts, the Primary Intermediate Court in Beijing declared on its microblog.</seg>
<seg id="5">President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, has made the fight against corruption a national priority, believing that the phenomenon is a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.</seg>
<seg id="6">The head of state has promised that justice would be just as inflexible with the powerful "tigers" as with the "flies" - the lesser officials - although just a handful of high-ranking officials has been sentenced, including former executives of oil giant PetroChina.</seg>
<seg id="7">The most recent high-profile case has been that of the former head of the CCP in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, who was sentenced to life in prison in September for corruption and power abuse. Previously his sights were set on the highest offices in the state.</seg>

<seg id="2">Norway is trying to beat 'sheep to sweater' record</seg>
<seg id="3">Previous record held by Australia is four hours 51 minutes</seg>
<seg id="4">Knitting show is latest in a line of 'Slow TV' broadcasts</seg>
<seg id="5">Settle back into a cosy chair and switch on the TV at 5.30pm tonight for a nine-hour knitting extravaganza.</seg>
<seg id="6">Norway is live streaming the prime-time hobby show in their attempt to air more sedate programs for their audience and British viewers will be able to tune in too.</seg>
<seg id="7">In an attempt to beat the world 'sheep to sweater' record, a team of Norwegian knitters will shear a ewe on live TV before spinning its wool and knitting a jumper in the shortest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="8">Knitting: Norway is live-streaming a nine-hour program on knitting with a four-hour segment solely on the hobby and a world record attempt</seg>
<seg id="9">The previous record, held by Australia, is four hours and 51 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="10">Viewers can build up to the thrilling challenge by watching four hours of knitting know how before the record attempt.</seg>
<seg id="11">'We'll just broadcast as long as they keep going.</seg>
<seg id="12">It should be a hit.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rune Møklebust, head of programming at Norwegian public service broadcaster NRK said.</seg>
<seg id="14">This latest easy-watching TV program is the latest in the Norwegian concept of 'Slow TV' which was launched in 2009 when NRK showed the view from the roof of a seven-hour train ride from Bergen to Oslo, the Telegraph reports.</seg>
<seg id="15">'It was the 100th anniversary of this route and we'd planned a couple of documentaries,' says Mr Møklebust.</seg>
<seg id="16">Then someone said, "why not film the whole trip?"</seg>
<seg id="17">We thought it would be something completely new ... and cheap.</seg>
<seg id="18">Jumpers: The program will include a 'sheep to sweater' world record where Norwegian yarn enthusiasts will attempt to beat the four-hour record set by Australia</seg>
<seg id="19">Although he initially thought it was a good idea, Mr Møklebust did have second thoughts while it was being aired as it was on a Friday night and up against stiff competition like the X Factor and the Norwegian version of Have I Got News For You.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the mundane programming proved a hit.</seg>
<seg id="21">He explained: 'Miraculously, we got more viewers.</seg>
<seg id="22">All these people wrote in to say, "I only meant to tune in for a minute but I watched for hours."</seg>
<seg id="23">Inspired by this success, Mr Møklebust subsequently positioned 11 cameras on the side of a cruise ship and broadcast the views throughout a five-and-a-half day journey along the Norwegian coast in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="24">The show attracted 3.2 million viewers and a 36 per cent share of Norway's TV viewing market.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since then, the channel has shown a 24-hour salmon fishing special, a 12-hour show about a fire being built and lit, and a 379-hour boat trip.</seg>
<seg id="26">Arve Hjelseth, a Sociologist from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, said: 'We're increasingly urban dwellers, so the mountains, fjords and coastline remind many Norwegians of where they come from.</seg>
<seg id="27">We're more stressed these days, too, so it's a time to relax as well as an antidote to modern TV, where camera angles shift every second.</seg>
<seg id="28">So called "Slow-TV" is strangely calming.</seg>
<seg id="29">British viewers can watch from 5.30pm GMT time on nrk.no.</seg>

<seg id="1">As crowds of horse-showing experts gathered in Cardiff to battle it out for Horse of the Year, they knew the competition would be tough.</seg>
<seg id="2">But nobody was quite ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.</seg>
<seg id="3">Not yet in school and just months on from taking his first steps, the toddler and his pet Shetland pony Toffee trotted through the three rounds with ease to take the top prize - leaving their 30 adult opponents trailing behind.</seg>
<seg id="4">The inseparable pair - who are the same height - were commended for appearance, behaviour and style at the annual contest run by Sunnybank Equestrian Centre, in Rudry near Cardiff.</seg>
<seg id="5">Taking to the stage against men and women in smart bowler hats, he tipped his flat cap at a jaunty angle and paraded two-year-old Toffee around the ring.</seg>
<seg id="6">Fenton was lauded by judges for natural handling skills well beyond his years.</seg>
<seg id="7">And Toffee received top marks for his appearance and personality.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fenton was given Toffee as a third birthday present last March and has practised with the Shetland pony every day since.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee are a great double act."</seg>
<seg id="10">They were up against all comers but the two of them walked off with the gold cup and rosette.</seg>
<seg id="11">It was only the second time he had competed with Toffee and we were all ecstatic when he won.</seg>
<seg id="12">Complete strangers in the arena all thought he was so phenomenal they wanted photos taken with him.</seg>
<seg id="13">The youngster, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for more than 10 years.</seg>

<seg id="1">ALP stands by its climate view</seg>
<seg id="2">Not a rubber stamp: Opposition climate change spokesman Mark Butler and Opposition Leader Bill Shorten outline the ALP's position on the carbon tax repeal.</seg>
<seg id="3">Australian businesses and households face months of uncertainty over energy pricing after the federal opposition resolved on Friday to stick with the unpopular carbon tax unless the government adopts its policy of an emissions trading scheme.</seg>
<seg id="4">In a move that guarantees Labor and the Greens will be able to frustrate the government's policy to scrap the carbon tax until the new Senate sits in the second half of next year, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten has announced Labor wants to dump the tax but will agree to its repeal only if the government ditches its Direct Action policy in favour of Labor's ETS.</seg>
<seg id="5">"If our amendments are not successful, we will oppose the government's repeal legislation in line with our long-held principle position to act on climate change," Mr Shorten said in Canberra, fresh from his first dedicated shadow cabinet meeting since becoming Labor leader.</seg>
<seg id="6">The decision locks the ALP into a potentially debilitating nine-month stand-off with the government, and could prompt Prime Minister Tony Abbott to seek a double-dissolution election - although that is unlikely given Coalition hopes of a more compliant Senate after July.</seg>
<seg id="7">It will also put Labor at odds with ordinary voters who just two months ago voted decisively in favour of the Coalition in an election dominated by the carbon price, and its perceived effect on household electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr Shorten said Labor was sticking to the policy it took to the election and predicted the Senate would go through its review processes and probably send the government's repeal bills to an inquiry.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Labor will never be a rubber stamp for Tony Abbott," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">Tony Abbott doesn't ... We won't be bullied and I won't be bullied by Tony Abbott merely because he doesn't accept the science of climate change.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some in Labor believe the party should find a way of allowing the fixed carbon price to die a quick death due to its toxic effect on Australian politics.</seg>
<seg id="12">They say Labor must ensure it is not "boxed in" to another election fight on the same ground it was defeated on last time.</seg>
<seg id="13">But others argue the party risks standing for nothing if it walks away from emissions trading as an automatic consequence of dumping the fixed-price period.</seg>
<seg id="14">Business leaders say they want the matter resolved after years of political warfare and policy confusion that has led to investment uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="15">Business Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott called on Labor to "respect the outcome of the election and not get in the way of what is a clear and fundamental Coalition government policy."</seg>
<seg id="16">"The last thing business and the economy needs is for actions by the Parliament to lead to one of the world's highest carbon prices remaining in place for an extended and uncertain period," she said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Labor's decision to protect the carbon tax came despite well-placed sources close to Mr Shorten suggesting the Labor leader was looking for ways to get the tax off the agenda.</seg>

<seg id="1">Randi Zuckerberg - "I Really Put Myself Out There" - NYTimes.com</seg>
<seg id="2">You were among the first 20 people hired at Facebook, and the sister of the C.E.O. Why did you leave?</seg>
<seg id="3">I had been working seven days a week for six straight years.</seg>
<seg id="4">Having a son was the first time I got to pull my head up and see that there was a whole big world out there besides just working for Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="5">Silicon Valley is known for having a male-dominated work culture.</seg>
<seg id="6">Did you feel as if being a woman affected how you were perceived?</seg>
<seg id="7">I was too young to understand it.</seg>
<seg id="8">There were a lot of times that maybe I let my hair down a little too much at events, and you know, I think unfortunately, a woman in business can't do that the same way men can.</seg>
<seg id="9">You're talking about all those videos of you singing at company events that made the rounds online.</seg>
<seg id="10">At the time, I thought, This is so fun, I get to do my passion and my work.</seg>
<seg id="11">Facebook stood for making the world more open and connected, sharing more.</seg>
<seg id="12">And I really put myself out there.</seg>
<seg id="13">I probably should have understood that colleagues and the world were still catching up to that.</seg>
<seg id="14">You've made some social media gaffes, but your new book, "Dot Complicated," is partly a guide to the etiquette of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="15">Are you the best person to be giving this advice?</seg>
<seg id="16">If people can learn from my mistakes, or feel more of a sense of connection with what I'm saying because I've shown some vulnerability, then I think we're at a better starting point.</seg>
<seg id="17">You got into trouble for tweeting nasty comments about a bouncer who wouldn't let you into a bar.</seg>
<seg id="18">Regarding that incident, you write, "I had no idea the Internet could propel my single tweet so far."</seg>
<seg id="19">Really?</seg>
<seg id="20">Obviously, I knew at that point that a single tweet from someone or a single Facebook post can go around the world.</seg>
<seg id="21">I just didn't know that my tweets or my Facebook posts could do that.</seg>
<seg id="22">The book never really goes near the subject of how our personal information is being tied to advertising.</seg>
<seg id="23">I think as a society we are starting to move on.</seg>
<seg id="24">When caller ID first launched, everyone was up in arms.</seg>
<seg id="25">Everyone felt their privacy was being violated.</seg>
<seg id="26">But you'd be hard-pressed to find someone now who says caller ID is a bad thing.</seg>
<seg id="27">But that information wasn't being sold to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="28">All these services are voluntary.</seg>
<seg id="29">People can use them or not use them if they want.</seg>
<seg id="30">From where I sit and what I see, with the usage of social media going up and up and up - it seems like a very Web 2.0 thing to harp on.</seg>
<seg id="31">Your sister, Arielle, is working at Google now.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm assuming she's there as a spy for the family?</seg>
<seg id="33">Aw, my sister is superserious about her job.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even without our last name, she'd still be working at one of the hot tech companies.</seg>
<seg id="35">Would that have been true of you?</seg>
<seg id="36">I hope so.</seg>
<seg id="37">I got very lucky in that I had a successful sibling who set me on a path in Silicon Valley.</seg>
<seg id="38">Everyone has a pet peeve about how others use social media.</seg>
<seg id="39">What's yours?</seg>
<seg id="40">Parents who post something like, "Ugh, I can't get my kids to look up from their video games."</seg>
<seg id="41">And then two seconds later, they post, "I just beat level 4,000 on Candy Crush."</seg>
<seg id="42">What are you most guilty of on Facebook?</seg>
<seg id="43">I'm a marketer, and sometimes I almost can't take it out of my personal life.</seg>
<seg id="44">I've had friends call me and say, "Your life looks so amazing."</seg>
<seg id="45">And I tell them: "I'm a marketer; I'm only posting the moments that are amazing."</seg>
<seg id="46">That drives people crazy about Facebook - that it turns all of us into marketers.</seg>
<seg id="47">I guess you can see it that way.</seg>
<seg id="48">On the other hand, it's also making us better storytellers.</seg>
<seg id="49">How?</seg>
<seg id="50">You basically get people's attention for just a few seconds with a photo, or status.</seg>
<seg id="51">I've had to stretch myself creatively to post things that I know will get people's attention.</seg>
<seg id="52">I think you must put a lot more time into your Facebook postings than anyone I know.</seg>
<seg id="53">That's probably right.</seg>

<seg id="1">India: Work begins on world's tallest statue</seg>
<seg id="2">Indian opposition leader Narendra Modi has launched the construction of the world's tallest statue.</seg>
<seg id="3">He is using the $338 million (£210m) project in honour of one of the country's founding fathers to undermine the ruling Nehru-Gandhi political family.</seg>
<seg id="4">The statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel - first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru's deputy and interior minister who was often at odds with him - is to be built on a river island in Gujarat, the home state of both Patel and Mr Modi.</seg>
<seg id="5">It will be built in four years and at 597ft will be twice the height of the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The world will be forced to look at India when this statue stands tall," Mr Modi said yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="7">The opposition leader rules Gujarat as chief minister and is the leading opposition candidate for prime minister in general elections to be held by May.</seg>
<seg id="8">His main rival in the election is the ruling Congress party's Rahul Gandhi, Nehru's great-grandson.</seg>
<seg id="9">Thursday marked the 138th anniversary of Patel's birth, and Mr Modi said earlier this week: "Every Indian regrets Sardar Patel did not become the first prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="10">Had he been the first prime minister, the country's fate and face would have been completely different.</seg>
<seg id="11">The comments, and the project, are seen as a not-so-subtle bid by Mr Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya ­Janata Party (BJP) to appropriate an independence-era hero ­associated with Congress, a party largely run by the Nehru- Gandhi family.</seg>
<seg id="12">Members of the family have ruled India for more than half the 66 years since it became an independent nation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Nehru, his daughter Indira Gandhi and grandson Rajiv Gandhi were all prime ministers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rajiv's widow Sonia Gandhi is the current leader of the Congress and Rahul, her son, is leading the party's campaign to take on Mr Modi at the elections.</seg>
<seg id="15">Opinion polls say Mr Modi is more popular than the Gandhi scion, and he is favoured by India's business titans for pro-investment policies and fast economic growth in Gujarat.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, the iron and bronze statue has been widely criticised as being unnecessary in a nation where one-third of the 1.2 billion people live in poverty.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is to be financed by the Gujarat government and public donations.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We're turning the whole of India into a necropolis," said Mohan Guruswamy, of the Centre for Policy Alternatives, a ­Delhi-based think-tank.</seg>
<seg id="19">A Gujarat government official involved in the project said it would be partially funded by small contributions, with the Gujarat government making up the difference.</seg>
<seg id="20">He denied it was a waste of funds, calling it "icon-based" development that would attract tourism.</seg>
<seg id="21">The sub-text to the controversy is what legacy Patel left when he died in 1950, and which of ­India's two main parties can legitimately lay claim to it.</seg>
<seg id="22">Some historians have suggested Patel was more pro-Hindu than Nehru, who was fiercely secular and opposed to the 1947 partition of British-ruled India into the independent nations of Hindu-majority India and Muslim Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="23">Patel is said to have taken a more pragmatic view and is known as the builder of modern India for cajoling and coercing the country's princely states into joining the new republic.</seg>
<seg id="24">Many in Gujarat feel Patel's legacy has been neglected by the Congress party, and Mr Modi has been quick to use that to his ­advantage.</seg>

<seg id="1">Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons making ability, watchdog group says</seg>
<seg id="2">Syria has destroyed critical equipment for producing chemical weapons and poison gas munitions, the global chemical weapons watchdog said Thursday as fierce clashes raged in the country's north, close to one of the sites where toxic agents are believed to be stored.</seg>
<seg id="3">Also Thursday, a Syrian activist group said more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the country's civil war nearly three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">The announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came one day ahead of the Nov.</seg>
<seg id="5">1 deadline set by The Hague-based organization for Damascus to destroy or "render inoperable" all chemical weapon production facilities and machinery for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling munitions.</seg>
<seg id="6">The completion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is a significant milestone in an ambitious timeline that aims to destroy all of Damascus' chemical weapons by mid-2014.</seg>
<seg id="7">Destruction of the equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, Damascus still has to start destroying existing weapons and stockpiles.</seg>
<seg id="9">The country is believed to have around 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin.</seg>
<seg id="10">The announcement came as fighting raged Thursday in the town of Safira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production facility as well as storage sites, reported the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id="11">The activist group, which has been tracking the death toll through a network of activists in Syria, said Thursday that 120,296 people have died.</seg>
<seg id="12">Of those, it said 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the government side, it said 29,954 are members of President Bashar Assad's armed forces, 18,678 are pro-government fighters and 187 are Lebanese Hezbollah militants.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also among the dead it said were 2,202 army defectors and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="15">On July 25, the U.N. estimated 100,000 have died in the conflict since March 2011.</seg>
<seg id="16">It has not updated that figure since.</seg>
<seg id="17">The conflict has forced some 2 million people to flee the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">Assad's troops have been battling rebels, many of them linked to al-Qaida groups, in Safira for weeks.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Observatory said there were casualties on both sides Thursday but had no specifics.</seg>
<seg id="20">The fighting underscored the dangers the chemical weapons' inspectors face as they race against tight deadlines in their mission to rid Syria of the toxic arsenal in the midst of an ongoing civil war.</seg>
<seg id="21">A statement from the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, said its team was "now satisfied that it has verified - and seen destroyed - all of Syria's declared critical production and mixing/filling equipment."</seg>
<seg id="22">It added that, "no further inspection activities are currently planned."</seg>
<seg id="23">Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed their first round of verification work, visiting 21 of 23 sites declared by Damascus.</seg>
<seg id="24">They were unable to visit two sites because of security concerns, the inspectors said.</seg>
<seg id="25">On Thursday, OPCW said the two locations were, according to Syria, "abandoned and ... the chemical weapons program items they contained were moved to other declared sites, which were inspected."</seg>
<seg id="26">It was not immediately clear if the facility in Safira was one of the two sites that OPCW inspectors were not able to visit.</seg>
<seg id="27">Syria has submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons that has to be approved next month by the OPCW's executive committee.</seg>
<seg id="28">"I salute the fortitude and courage you've all demonstrated in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization," the watchdog's director-general, Ahmet Uzumcu, said in comments released by the OPCW.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now in its third year, the civil war pits the primarily Sunni Muslim rebels against Assad's government and its security forces, which are stacked with members of his Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam.</seg>
<seg id="30">In other developments, the Observatory's chief Rami Abdurrahman said there had been a strong explosion Wednesday inside an air defense facility in Syria's coastal province of Latakia.</seg>
<seg id="31">The cause of the blast was not known, he said.</seg>

<seg id="2">The head of internal security in China accused a group of Uighur separatists from Xinjiang on Friday of being behind the car bomb attack in Tiananmen Square in the centre of Beijing on Monday, which left five people dead.</seg>
<seg id="3">The vehicle, an SUV, raced towards the crowd in the famous square in the Chinese capital, the symbol of the bloody 1989 suppression, before catching fire, killing its three occupants and two passers-by.</seg>
<seg id="4">Meng Jianzhu, a member of the politburo in charge of internal security issues, accused the East Turkestan Islamic Movement of instigating the attack.</seg>
<seg id="5">Numerous Uighurs, a Turkish-speaking minority in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province East Turkestan.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese government believes the movement is responsible for the frequent outbreaks of violence in the province, sparked by demands for independence.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The violent terrorist incident that occurred in Beijing was organized and premeditated," said Meng on Hong Kong television channel Phoenix TV.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The group hiding behind the scenes was the East Turkestan Islamic Movement," he added, his words being relayed by the Xinhua News Agency.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Chinese police have identified the driver of the vehicle, whose name suggests he is of Uighur origin, and stated that his wife and mother were with him in the car.</seg>
<seg id="10">The vehicle also held containers full of petrol and a flag with orthodox religious writing on it.</seg>
<seg id="11">The incident left 42 people injured.</seg>
<seg id="12">The East Turkestan Islamic Movement is considered by the United States and the United Nations to be a terrorist organization.</seg>

<seg id="2">Its net profit for the third quarter went down to $4,950 million, or $2.57 per share, as opposed to $5,250 million, or $2.69 per share, the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="3">Analysts questioned by Reuters were counting on an average profit of $2.71 per share.</seg>
<seg id="4">The group produced 2.59 million oil-equivalent barrels per day during the course of the quarter, an increase compared to the 2.52 million barrels per day produced a year before.</seg>
<seg id="5">The company is targeting 2.65 million barrels per day for this year, with an increase of 25% in production planned by 2017.</seg>
<seg id="6">The majority of the growth in the years to come will come from its liquefied natural gas schemes in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="7">Because of the cost of these schemes, annual investment costs have gone up by seven thousand million dollars in two years and are expected to reach 36,700 million dollars in 2013.</seg>

<seg id="5">BILLIONAIRE Clive Palmer is the new Federal Member for Fairfax - having won the seat in a recount that left a margin of just 53 votes.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Palmer United Party leader originally won the seat with seven votes, triggering an automatic recount.</seg>

<seg id="10">"Wait for a while, I can't give you all the news tonight, when I get into Parliament we can table, you can read it and you'll love it - Campbell will love it, too," he told ABC TV.</seg>
<seg id="11">What I've said is I've got a certain amount of evidence, I don't have conclusive evidence, but it's in the public interest and we'll put it out there in the political debate.</seg>

<seg id="15">Mr Palmer originally finished ahead of his Liberal National Party challenger Ted O'Brien, but the electoral commission on September 21 automatically ordered a recount because the margin was less than 100 votes.</seg>
<seg id="16">``I'm looking forward to making a positive contribution to the battle of ideas in Canberra," he told AAP.</seg>
<seg id="17">Queensland's richest man has been an outspoken critic of the Australian Electoral Commission throughout the process, hurling accusations of incompetence.</seg>
<seg id="18">The AEC today announced more than 1300 votes had been lost during the intial WA Senate count, which left PUP candidate Dio Wang with a Senate spot.</seg>
<seg id="19">How do you manage to lose that many votes and will somebody take responsibility for this fiasco and fall on their sword?</seg>
<seg id="20">Mr Palmer said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="21">The AEC has just become a joke with some of the mistakes that have been made during the 2013 federal election counting.</seg>
<seg id="22">""The recount in WA should be declared invalid and the original result restored as it was the only one which has every ballot counted.""</seg>
<seg id="23">"Mr Palmer questioned whether the AEC was attempting to "rig" the election."</seg>
<seg id="24">""We have already seen a number of discrepancies in the counting in my electorate of Fairfax on the Sunshine Coast," he said."</seg>
<seg id="25">""Is the AEC trying to rig the election?</seg>
<seg id="26">Or are they just completely incompetent?</seg>
<seg id="27">Certainly our experience from this election is that there are many issues with Australia's voting system and the AEC needs urgent reform.</seg>
<seg id="28">Mr Palmer also thanked the 90,000 voters of Fairfax - about half of who voted for him.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I am thrilled by the result and humbled by the responsibility of representing the people of Fairfax in federal parliament," Mr Palmer said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="30">I'd like to thank Ted O'Brien and all the other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="31">I wish Ted and his family all the best for the future.</seg>
<seg id="32">""I would also like to thank the AEC staff on the Sunshine Coast who had a very difficult job and had a great deal of pressure on them from the AEC apparatchik from Canberra and Brisbane.""</seg>
<seg id="33">The LNP's Ted O'Brien, who narrowly missed out on holding the Sunshine Coast seat for the party, acknowledged his opponents victory in a statement issued this afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="34">""I congratulate Clive Palmer on being declared the next Member for Fairfax by the Australian</seg>
<seg id="35">Electoral Commission," he said."</seg>
<seg id="36">""It's been a long eight weeks for everyone involved, not least the local community here in</seg>
<seg id="37">Fairfax that has waited patiently for the count to conclude.""</seg>
<seg id="38">""I would like to thank the hardworking staff of the AEC and also my scrutineers whose</seg>
<seg id="39">generosity in volunteering their time and expertise has been extraordinary.""</seg>
<seg id="40">"Mr O'Brien said the close result was confirmation of the "the old adage that every vote counts""</seg>
<seg id="41">""But also that every preference counts," he said."</seg>
<seg id="42">The LNP says it is yet to make a decision about whether it will take the fight to the Court of Disputed Returns.</seg>
<seg id="43">The party has 40 days to lodge a petition and express doubts about the validity of the result.</seg>
<seg id="44">LNP State Director Brad Henderson accused Mr Palmer's scrutineers of delaying the count by unnecessarily challenging the authenticity of ballots.</seg>
<seg id="45">""I note that during the subsequent review of those ballots by the Australian Electoral Officer (AEO), not once did the PUP representatives raise any issues with their authenticity or provide any reason to the AEO for questioning their authenticity," he said."</seg>
<seg id="46">""Given the sheer scale of this process, in terms of the number and nature of challenges and determinations made, the LNP will now take some time to consider its position.""</seg>
<seg id="47">But Mr Henderson expressed no dissatisfaction with the AEC.</seg>
<seg id="48">""The LNP takes this opportunity to express its thanks to the AEC and its staff for their hard work and to the people of Fairfax for their patience," he said."</seg>
<seg id="49">""We also acknowledge the hard work and commitment of our candidate, Ted O'Brien, throughout the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="50">Ted has conducted himself with dignity and good grace during what has been an arduous campaign and recount process.</seg>

<seg id="1">Holiday-season retail sales look bleak, Morgan Stanley predicts</seg>
<seg id="2">That's what researchers at Morgan Stanley are saying in the first major forecast of a decidedly dour holiday season.</seg>
<seg id="3">Retailers hoping for a respite from a year of so-so shopping can instead expect the worst Thanksgiving-to-Christmas sales since 2008, the financial services firm said Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">Five years ago, the industry was free-falling into recession.</seg>
<seg id="5">This year, a new collection of worrisome economic conditions looms as stores gear up for a period that can sometimes account for 40% of annual revenue.</seg>
<seg id="6">Shopper confidence is low.</seg>
<seg id="7">The recent federal government stalemate and shutdown was a damper.</seg>
<seg id="8">The window for holiday shopping is six days shorter than it was last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, consumer spending, which makes up more than two-thirds of economic activity, is actually getting a boost.</seg>
<seg id="10">Gasoline prices are lower, and net worth is rising because of higher real estate values and a stock market upswing, Morgan Stanley said in a report.</seg>
<seg id="11">But instead of shoveling extra money into gifts, many Americans are plowing it into big-ticket items such as cars, appliances and home improvement goods.</seg>
<seg id="12">The report anticipates that during the fourth quarter, retailers will see a scant 1.7% increase in sales at stores open at least a year.</seg>
<seg id="13">Such same-store sales are an important indicator because they eliminate the effect of opening and closing outlets during the previous 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="14">Strip out struggling J.C. Penney Co., which researchers predict will roll out deep discounts early in the season, and projected sales growth slips to 1.6%.</seg>
<seg id="15">That's less than half of last year's 3.5% expansion, according to Morgan Stanley.</seg>
<seg id="16">The dire outlook contrasts with much sunnier figures from retail trade groups.</seg>
<seg id="17">The International Council of Shopping Centers said Thursday that net operating income per square foot at malls hit a record high in the third quarter.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 7.4% increase from the same period in 2012 was the sixth straight gain.</seg>
<seg id="19">In early October, the National Retail Federation said it expected holiday sales to rise 3.9% to $602.1 billion.</seg>
<seg id="20">The forecast - described as "neither robust nor pessimistic" - shows improvement from last year's 3.5% boost.</seg>
<seg id="21">This week, the trade group said September retail sales increased a "healthy" 0.6% from August, with "broad sales gains" in most categories.</seg>
<seg id="22">The apparel sector was not among them.</seg>
<seg id="23">"While far from robust, consumers are shopping, but they are spending both discriminately and moderately," NRF Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="24">But in the federal government's assessment of September retail performance, sales slid 0.1% compared with August, to $425.9 billion.</seg>
<seg id="25">The gauge, which includes food service, gas stations and autos, was dragged down substantially by a plunge in car sales and by lukewarm back-to-school shopping.</seg>
<seg id="26">Analysts such as Lindsey M. Piegza of Sterne Agee attributed the decline to "tepid job creation and minimal income growth," as well as "the ongoing shenanigans in Washington."</seg>
<seg id="27">"Retailers are already initiating holiday discounts to lure in customers," Piegza wrote in a report this week.</seg>
<seg id="28">But many more see the declining trend in spending, and bracing for a weak holiday season, are lowering sales forecasts and reducing seasonal hiring.</seg>
<seg id="29">Morgan Stanley researchers wrote that they expect to see "the most intense promotional holiday environment since 2008."</seg>
<seg id="30">Price-slashing may emerge earlier in the season in a panicky attempt to attract shoppers at the expense of profit, according to the report.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the third quarter, malls featured 20% more promotions than they had a year earlier, researchers wrote.</seg>
<seg id="32">JCPenney, Kohl's and Macy's are all opening their doors to bargain hunters Thanksgiving evening instead of in the wee hours of Black Friday.</seg>
<seg id="33">"While the ability to spend more is apparent, willingness remains the key question," the Morgan Stanley researchers wrote.</seg>
<seg id="34">Some retailers, however, will come out ahead.</seg>
<seg id="35">Morgan Stanley expects the best holiday sales growth to come from American fashion company Michael Kors Holdings, whose stock has surged more than 50% this year.</seg>
<seg id="36">The company, which is not prone to discounting, appeals to women who are interested in accessories, according to researchers.</seg>
<seg id="37">The report said other probable winners include Victoria's Secret, which avoids "irrational promotions," and Ross Stores Inc., whose discount offerings are likely to draw shoppers away from department stores.</seg>
<seg id="38">Teen retailers such as Aeropostale, Abercrombie & Fitch and American Eagle will continue to suffer as young women and girls look for more inexpensive and unique clothing from the likes of Forever 21 and Urban Outfitters, according to Morgan Stanley.</seg>
<seg id="39">Amazon.com is primed for a strong holiday, hiring 40% more seasonal employees than last year, Morgan Stanley said.</seg>
<seg id="40">The e-commerce giant, along with other online retailers, could grab as much as 13% of Thanksgiving-to-Christmas sales, up from 11% in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="41">"We expect time-strapped and value-conscious consumers to look online to stretch their dollars further and for convenience," researchers wrote.</seg>

<seg id="1">George Kerevan: Europe break-up gives Scots choice</seg>
<seg id="2">Another day, another independence scare story.</seg>
<seg id="3">This time we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the Europe-wide free-travel zone as a condition of EU membership.</seg>
<seg id="4">Cue stories about passport controls at Berwick and a barbed wire border along Hadrian's Wall.</seg>
<seg id="5">True, the Strathclyde paper pointed out the possible economic benefits of freer movement with the rest of Europe, though - predictably - that did not figure in the headlines.</seg>
<seg id="6">Nor did anyone point out that the EU member states spend much of their time bending their formal rules if it suits them.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since Scotland isn't in the Schengen area now, continued non-compliance would be a cheap concession for Brussels to offer up in return for whatever it really wanted out of the Scots.</seg>
<seg id="8">So, a non-story, then.</seg>
<seg id="9">And one that is so long in the tooth it has become fossilised: I first heard the "independence means passport controls" canard at least 40 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">Yet there is an interesting point lost in this retelling of a whiskery old tale.</seg>
<seg id="11">Why should an independent Scotland be expected to do Europe's bidding, anyway?</seg>
<seg id="12">Why trade London's yoke for that of Brussels, especially now?</seg>
<seg id="13">Here is the real European news: the great, post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.</seg>
<seg id="15">Across the EU, parties which are dedicated to opposing the EU, or to scrapping the euro as a common currency, are gaining ground.</seg>
<seg id="16">Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany Party - founded only this year - came from nowhere to grab nearly five million votes in September's federal elections, thus effectively knocking the Free Democrats (equivalent to our own Lib Dems) out of the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="17">There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, the current economic crisis has proved a watershed.</seg>
<seg id="19">The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the straitjacket imposed on national economies through adherence to the common currency, has led many people to think Project Europe has gone too far.</seg>
<seg id="20">The crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits - that was true only of Greece.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rather, the euro system locked in its members at exchange rates favourable to German exporters - something German politicians want to keep.</seg>
<seg id="22">Without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation, southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage vis-à-vis Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">The only recourse is to slash wages and public spending - spurred on by Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Beyond the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity malaise.</seg>
<seg id="25">As a result of "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels - code for subsidising French and German energy firms at the consumer's expense - European industry pays twice as much for electricity, and four times as much for gas, as in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="26">That is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we've already seen at Grangemouth.</seg>
<seg id="27">All the wage freezes in the world won't stop the European petrochemicals industry being hammered by cheap US shale gas.</seg>
<seg id="28">As a result, revolt is brewing, especially in France, once the EU's main cheerleader.</seg>
<seg id="29">After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check, and to give Paris equal billing in the world with Washington.</seg>
<seg id="30">But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport to political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the battered French economy struggling.</seg>
<seg id="31">Result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, anti-EU National Front has just won a crucial by-election, knocking the ruling Socialists into third place.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the vote - a timely warning to British Labour that they can't assume a split on the right will automatically favour the left.</seg>
<seg id="33">What is Le Pen doing with her newfound popularity among the French white, working class?</seg>
<seg id="34">She wants to use next year's EU elections to create an anti-EU, anti-common currency bloc across the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="35">If, as is very possible, anti-EU parties do well in these elections, such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="36">Here's my point: sometime soon growing anti-EU and anti-common currency feeling in Europe will coalesce to kill the euro.</seg>
<seg id="37">The EU won't disappear, but it will revert to something more like the loose "Europe of the (Sovereign) Nations" favoured by General de Gaulle.</seg>
<seg id="38">Germany and a few of its satellite economies might keep the euro but France and southern Europe will revive their own currencies.</seg>
<seg id="39">I expect the UK will distance itself from this project, hoping to cosy up to the US.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests Britain will be left out in the Atlantic cold.</seg>
<seg id="41">Where does this leave Scotland?</seg>
<seg id="42">We can choose to be a region of (essentially) Little England.</seg>
<seg id="43">Or we can defend our own economic interests - which includes telling Berlin and Brussels where to get off.</seg>
<seg id="44">I suspect that Scotland could do well inside a looser European arrangement provided we kept our own currency.</seg>
<seg id="45">Co-operation with other like-minded countries will be easier in a non-federal Europe of the Nations.</seg>
<seg id="46">Otherwise we should consider emulating Norway and retaining our economic independence.</seg>
<seg id="47">The SNP government in Scotland is - remarkably-- the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, having won a spectacular majority in 2011 on the basis of opposing the cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour's chancellor Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition.</seg>
<seg id="48">It would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence only to accept austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.</seg>

<seg id="1">Spanish Message With One Word That Needs No Translation</seg>
<seg id="2">Fisher Price Commercial: A Spanish-language advertisement for Fisher Price toys.</seg>
<seg id="3">TO get ready for the holiday season, Mattel is adding some informal Spanish language to a marketing campaign meant to reach Latina mothers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The campaign, called " "Toy Feliz," or "Toy Happy" in English, is a play on the Spanish phrase "Estoy feliz," or "I'm happy."</seg>
<seg id="5">It is the first time that Mattel is reaching out to Latinas with a message in Spanish for brands including Barbie, Fisher-Price and Hot Wheels.</seg>
<seg id="6">Previous campaigns were translations of English-language advertising for specific products.</seg>
<seg id="7">Other attempts to reach Latina mothers have included publications that Mattel distributes in doctor's offices that are meant for pregnant women.</seg>
<seg id="8">Attracting Latino customers represents a major opportunity for revenue growth.</seg>
<seg id="9">"When we look across the toy industry, it's been fairly sluggish for the past couple of years," said Lisa McKnight, the senior vice president for marketing in North America at Mattel.</seg>
<seg id="10">When we look at the Hispanic market, they represent about 15 percent of toy sales.</seg>
<seg id="11">If we spoke more directly, more deliberately and more authentically to Latina moms, we could really elevate the business and drive growth.</seg>
<seg id="12">The growing economic and social clout of Latinas was highlighted this summer in a report by Nielsen.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the report, called "Latina Power Shift," 21 percent of Latin women earned more than $75,000 a year in 2013, compared with 16 percent in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="14">Eighty-six percent of Latinas say they are the primary or joint decision maker for household purchases.</seg>
<seg id="15">In 2011, 23 percent of all births in the United States were to a Latina.</seg>
<seg id="16">In order to reach its target audience with an authentic voice, Mattel hired the Axis Agency, a multicultural company that is part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.</seg>
<seg id="17">The campaign is estimated to cost $1.5 million to $2 million.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The idea was to communicate to moms and to communicate at the same time to kids and to have an emotional campaign," said Peter Sanchez, the executive creative director at Axis.</seg>
<seg id="19">Understanding the culture is key, even more than language.</seg>
<seg id="20">It's about the cultural insights that make you feel you can relate to them.</seg>
<seg id="21">The centerpiece of the campaign, which will debut on Friday, is a television commercial that features a Latino family gearing up for the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="22">The young son, bursting with anticipation, lets his family know that he is waiting for his gifts to arrive.</seg>
<seg id="23">The ad plays on the word estoy by having the son say " "Toy esperando," or "I'm waiting," and " "Toy portandome bien," or "I'm behaving myself."</seg>
<seg id="24">The commercial then directs parents to toyfeliz.com, where they can download coupons for brands featured in the campaign that can be used at Walmart.</seg>
<seg id="25">In addition to the 15- and 30-second television spots on Univision networks in Los Angeles, Houston and Miami, 60-second radio ads will air in those markets on Univision-owned stations.</seg>
<seg id="26">Select Walmarts will also carry in-store marketing in Spanish.</seg>
<seg id="27">The campaign is expected to run through early January in order to capture sales from Three Kings Day on Jan.</seg>
<seg id="28">6, which is celebrated by many Latino families.</seg>
<seg id="29">Ms. McKnight of Mattel said the company was testing the campaign in cities with large Latino populations to see how well it did and to conduct quantitative research on Latino consumers.</seg>
<seg id="30">Latina mothers, Ms. McKnight said, spend on average about $20 more than other consumers on each toy shopping trip and are loyal to toy brands.</seg>
<seg id="31">A successful holiday campaign could have lasting implications for Mattel, she said.</seg>
<seg id="32">"We are marketing our mainline general market items, but the potential for this target audience and the implications for product, marketing and packaging are tremendous," Ms. McKnight said, alluding to Latino-themed toys or characters and more specific marketing in Spanish or even bilingual campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="33">The campaign also has the potential to go beyond the Christmas season, Ms. McKnight said.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We want to make sure we are talking to Latina moms on a regular basis and not just during the holiday period," she said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Children should be taught myths and legends as "models for a way of life", author says.</seg>
<seg id="2">Tales of Thor could show "brute strength is no match for subtle trickery," while the Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.</seg>
<seg id="3">Saying many of the myths would be "far too wild, far too scandalous and in some cases far too filthy to be taught in schools," Crossley-Holland advocated a "careful selection" of age-appropriate works.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I find it wonderful that in America, myth and folklore already has a part in education," he said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I have been advocating it as a plan for twenty years.</seg>

<seg id="9">Not that everything has to be simplified or come to a happy ending, but that there is an innate sense of good and evil.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bulldogs hopeful Josh Morris will re-sign and fill Barba's vacant fullback spot</seg>
<seg id="2">Coach Tim Sheens opts for an experienced lineup for the Kangaroos' World Cup opener, with Andrew Fifita the sole debutant.</seg>
<seg id="3">CANTERBURY Bulldogs chief executive Raelene Castle hopes Josh Morris will re-sign with the NRL club, but brotherly love could convince the star centre to return to St George Illawarra.</seg>
<seg id="4">Morris comes out of contract at the end of next season and is considering rejoining twin brother Brett at the Dragons in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, Ben Barba's exit from the Bulldogs might just convince Morris to stay at Canterbury.peMorris has established himself as one of the best centres in the game since joining the Bulldogs at the end of 2008.</seg>
<seg id="6">And the 27-year-old added another string to his bow when he starred at fullback during Barba's absence at the tail-end of last season.</seg>
<seg id="7">Morris was initially reluctant to move from his preferred position, but he may change his tune now that Barba has left.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Josh is an important part of our squad and once he gets back from the rugby league world cup we'll be having discussions with him about extending his contract," Castle said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He's a quality player.</seg>
<seg id="10">Any time you have an international player in your squad, you want to make sure that you keep them, because they add such significant value.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Bulldogs had been linked to Warriors fullback Kevin Locke and Parramatta flyer Jarryd Hayne, but Castle said the club would probably focus on developing their own young talent.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It's a very complex jigsaw puzzle," Castle said.</seg>
<seg id="13">We haven't had any significant discussions with any other fullbacks at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="14">A lot of the significant fullbacks are still on contract with their clubs.</seg>
<seg id="15">""We've got some young talent coming through and Des is going to have a crack at developing those into the next Ben Barba.""</seg>
<seg id="16">Castle was in Perth this week to announce the club's decision to play a home game in Western Australia next season.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Bulldogs reached the grand final in 2012, but were knocked out of the finals this year, by Newcastle, at the first hurdle.</seg>
<seg id="18">Castle says it's time for the club to repeat their effort of 2004, when they beat the Roosters 16-13 in the premiership decider.</seg>
<seg id="19">""It's been 10 years between drinks for us, and that's a really long period of time.</seg>
<seg id="20">Winning a grand final is top of our list.</seg>

<seg id="7">Only 15% of those who lose a child choose cremation.</seg>
<seg id="8">In his book, La Mort en Cendres, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-chairperson of the Comité National d'Ethique du Funéraire emphasises the "violence" that cremation represents for those left behind.</seg>
<seg id="9">With cremation, there is a sense of "violence committed against the body of a loved one", which will be "reduced to a pile of ashes" in a very short time instead of after a process of decomposition that "would accompany the stages of grief".</seg>
<seg id="10">There is also a "symbolic violence" that relates to the "obliteration of the person's singularity and of distinctive symbols", which are reduced to the "anonymity" of ashes.</seg>
<seg id="11">Why is this accepted without difficulty in certain Nordic and protestant countries, but is still taken badly in France?</seg>
<seg id="12">"Because cremation is a recent development," says Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Thanatological Society and author of the book Apprivoiser la Mort.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Catholic Church only started tolerating it in 1963, a fact that has restricted efforts at getting to grips with it.</seg>
<seg id="14">For François Michaud-Nérard, director general of Funerary Services for the City of Paris, getting to grips with cremation is about giving the deceased a ceremony as dignified as it would have been with an inhumation.</seg>
<seg id="15">The annual Ipsos survey shows the strength of attachment to the arrangement of the ceremony.</seg>
<seg id="16">77% of French want one for their loved ones, be it religious (53%) or civil (24%).</seg>
<seg id="17">Nowadays, 73% of people choosing cremation want a ceremony to be arranged.</seg>
<seg id="18">66% of atheists or non-believers also want one.</seg>
<seg id="19">Crematoria have adapted to this change in society.</seg>
<seg id="20">"For a decade or so, they have been trying hard to spare families from the feeling of violence in waiting for an hour and a half, doing nothing, followed immediately by their being handed the ashes," observes Michaud-Nérard.</seg>
<seg id="21">70% of establishments now offer a master of ceremonies to conduct the following ritual in the presence of the body: greet the congregation, mention the deceased by name, connect the deceased to those present, evoke who the person was, give sense to their death, organise a farewell.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is what has been happening at the Père Lachaise crematorium since 1998.</seg>
<seg id="23">The masters of ceremonies are often people who have moved into this new type of employment.</seg>
<seg id="24">There are also former Catholic priests.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is in this context that, since 2010, the Père Lachaise crematorium has been organising a number of memorial ceremonies, lay and non-religious, on All Saints Day, to which it invites the families of all those who have been cremated during the course of the year.</seg>
<seg id="26">For the second consecutive year, one of these ceremonies has been relayed online, for those could not attend.</seg>
<seg id="27">The crematorium has authorised us to broadcast it.</seg>

<seg id="2">A bride in France only just made it through the ceremony before she gave birth.</seg>
<seg id="3">A BRIDE gave birth only minutes after tying the knot in France, making it more of a "big day" than anticipated.</seg>
<seg id="4">"It did rather shake us up," admitted Jean-Robert Gachet, mayor of Jallais, after hearing that mother and baby were doing well.</seg>
<seg id="5">Saturday's ceremony at 11am (7pm AEST) was nearly called off after the heavily pregnant bride had several false alarms, although her due date was July 14.</seg>
<seg id="6">The bride was "definitely a bit worn out, but we put that down to the stress of the wedding."</seg>
<seg id="7">"I tried to hurry it up a bit so that she didn't get too tired," said Mr Gachet.</seg>

<seg id="3">A missing three-year-old boy was found asleep under his bed after a two-hour search involving a police helicopter and more than 200 villagers.</seg>
<seg id="4">Police found the boy curled up in a pile of clothes under his bed in a second search of the property in Abbotskerswell, Devon.</seg>
<seg id="5">His mother raised the alarm at 21:15 GMT after going to check on her son who was found just before 23:00 GMT.</seg>
<seg id="6">She said she was "amazed" at the "overwhelming response."</seg>
<seg id="7">"I want to say a heartfelt thank you to everyone who turned out," she said.</seg>
<seg id="8">The force helicopter, police dogs and the Dartmoor Rescue Team were all involved in the search of the village near Newton Abbot.</seg>
<seg id="9">An appeal on Facebook led to hundreds of villagers joining the search.</seg>
<seg id="10">'Overwhelming' response</seg>
<seg id="11">Police said they were "very grateful for the response and offers of support they received from the local community."</seg>
<seg id="12">A spokesman said: "On arrival, police were advised by the child's mother that she had searched the house and the boy was not inside.</seg>
<seg id="13">An initial quick search of the property was conducted by officers.</seg>
<seg id="14">The search was then taken outside due to immediate concerns for the boy's welfare.</seg>
<seg id="15">When the child was not located in the local area, officers carried out a thorough search of the home and the boy was found safe and well.</seg>

<seg id="1">British scientists discover reindeer eyes change colour from gold to blue over course of the seasons</seg>
<seg id="2">Scientists have discovered that reindeer eyes change colour from gold to blue over the course of the year - the first time this has ever been shown to happen in mammals.</seg>
<seg id="3">A British-funded study has revealed that the animals are uniquely adapted to Arctic winters, which experience continuous daylight in summer and continuous darkness in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many other mammals, during the bright summers reindeer eyes reflect back most light through the retina - so they appear gold.</seg>
<seg id="5">A kind of enhanced night vision kicks in through winter, however, when a layer of tissue behind the retina becomes less reflective and appears blue.</seg>
<seg id="6">This increases the sensitivity of the reindeer eye to limited winter light - and is a vital tool in helping them survive the challenging Arctic conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">"This gives them an advantage when it comes to spotting predators, which could save their lives," said lead researcher Professor Glen Jeffery.</seg>
<seg id="8">"This is the first time a colour change of this kind has been shown in mammals," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">By changing the colour of the TL in the eye reindeer have flexibility to cope better with the extreme differences between light levels in their habitat between seasons.</seg>
<seg id="10">The study was conducted by Professor Jeffery and his colleagues at University College London, working in tandem with the University of Tromsø in Norway.</seg>
<seg id="11">They suggested that the colour change may be caused by pressure within the eyes.</seg>
<seg id="12">In winter the reindeers" pupils exist in a permanent state of dilation, which prevents fluid in the eyeball from draining naturally.</seg>
<seg id="13">The pressure compresses the tissue behind the retina, they said, reducing the space between collagen in the tissue and therefore reflecting the shorter wavelengths of the blue light common in Arctic winters.</seg>

<seg id="15">Previous work from Professor Jeffery and Norwegian colleagues from Tromsø had shown that Arctic reindeer eyes can also see ultraviolet, which is abundant in Arctic light but invisible to humans, and that they use this to find food and see predators.</seg>

<seg id="1">SAN FRANCISCO -- Google is rolling out KitKat, the latest version of its popular software for smartphones and tablets with an ambitious goal: to get Android devices all over the world to run the latest version of the software.</seg>
<seg id="2">During a news conference in San Francisco, Sundar Pichai, Google's senior vice president of Android, Chrome and apps, said Google created KitKat to reach the next billion smartphone users by making the new software work well on low-end phones in addition to the pricier Samsung Galaxy and HTC devices.</seg>
<seg id="3">Emerging markets represent a major growth opportunity for Android.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pichai said Google is seeing "stunning growth" in places such as Brazil, Russia, Indonesia and Mexico -- three times the growth rate of the U.S.</seg>
<seg id="5">But manufacturers who make cheaper phones particularly for the developing world often use older versions of Android that don't use as much memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">Google is trying to address a key competitive disadvantage versus Apple called "fragmentation."</seg>
<seg id="7">Fragmentation makes it tougher for Android app developers to run the latest version of their services across all devices.</seg>
<seg id="8">By way of comparison, nearly two-thirds of Apple devices run the latest version of iOS software.</seg>
<seg id="9">So Google removed unnecessary services and reduced how much memory the operating system and applications such as Chrome and YouTube consume, making it possible for Android to run on devices that have 512 megabytes of memory, which are popular in much of the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">KitKat will be available on Nexus 4,7,10, the Samsung Galaxy S4 and HTC One on Google Play in coming weeks, the company said.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is the most aggressive push yet from Google to get the latest versions of Android on lower-cost devices that are spreading quickly in developing countries.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's unclear whether Google can get manufacturers and carriers to push software upgrades to existing Android devices, but Pichai said getting KitKat on new devices would quickly bear fruit for Google.</seg>
<seg id="13">Google on Thursday is also debuting the long-awaited Nexus 5 smartphone, which comes loaded with KitKat.</seg>
<seg id="14">The phone is available in black and white and goes on sale unlocked and without a contract on Google Play in the U.S., Canada, Britain, Australia, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Japan and South Korea on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="15">It will also be sold by Sprint, T-Mobile, Amazon, Best Buy and RadioShack.</seg>
<seg id="16">It's selling for $349 for the 16GB version and $399 for the 32GB version.</seg>
<seg id="17">With the Nexus5, Google is stepping up its competition with Apple's iPhone.</seg>
<seg id="18">"This is a cutting-edge device at an incredible price," Pichai said of the Nexus 5.</seg>
<seg id="19">Price is critical in developing markets, where people have less money to spend on devices.</seg>
<seg id="20">That's far cheaper than Apple's new iPhones.</seg>
<seg id="21">The iPhone 5c, the cheaper of the two new iPhones, costs $549 for a 16GB version that is unlocked and comes without a wireless contract.</seg>
<seg id="22">Google partnered with LG to develop the Nexus5, which Google says is slimmer and faster than previous Nexus phones.</seg>
<seg id="23">It has a five-inch HD display and optical image stabilization as well as a new HDR mode that automatically takes a flurry of photos and combines them to give the best possible single shot.</seg>
<seg id="24">With KitKat on the Nexus 5, Google unveiled some new features that it says brings Google power and smarts to Android.</seg>
<seg id="25">For example, swipe once on the Nexus 5 launcher to get to Google Now.</seg>
<seg id="26">Say "OK, Google" to launch voice search, send a text, get directions or play a song.</seg>
<seg id="27">Google is also experimenting with new technology that gives users results from both the Web and the apps on their phone when they search for information.</seg>
<seg id="28">Google is working with 10 mobile apps in the pilot program, including Flixster, Etsy, Trulia, Open Table and Expedia.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is to become available to more developers in coming months.</seg>
<seg id="30">Like it?</seg>

<seg id="1">Nissan Cuts Profit Outlook, Revamps Management</seg>
<seg id="2">YOKOHAMA, Japan - Nissan Motor Co., Japan's second-biggest automaker, cut its earnings forecast Friday and reshuffled its leadership lineup to cope with quality issues and tougher-than-expected conditions in many markets.</seg>
<seg id="3">The company posted a 107.8 billion yen ($1.1 billion) net profit for the July-September quarter, a meager 2 percent increase from 105.7 billion yen a year earlier.</seg>
<seg id="4">Quarterly sales rose 16 percent to 2.5 trillion yen ($25.4 billion).</seg>
<seg id="5">Nissan President and Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn attributed the weaker-than-expected performance to a variety of troubles, chief among them weakness in many emerging markets and painfully expensive recalls.</seg>
<seg id="6">He announced a management reshuffle that will make the company's chief operating officer, Toshiyuki Shiga, a vice chairman and appoint three other executives as COOs.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Our slow performance required immediate action to be taken," said Ghosn, speaking at Nissan's headquarters in Yokohama, near Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="8">Ghosn emphasized that Shiga's move was not meant as "revenge," but was part of what he said is an overdue start to bring fresh talent into Nissan's top management.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I can tell you nobody is taking this as a kind of punishment," Ghosn said.</seg>
<seg id="10">Everybody recognizes there is a need to rejuvenate.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is a good chance to start.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ghosn sought to pre-empt any speculation about his own departure, saying he had no news to offer.</seg>
<seg id="13">Instead, he underscored his desire to take responsibility for ensuring that Nissan's performance improves.</seg>
<seg id="14">The company cut its profit forecast for the full fiscal year ending March by 15.5 percent to 355 billion yen ($3.6 billion).</seg>
<seg id="15">Nissan said last week that it was recalling more than 188,000 Nissan and Infiniti SUVs worldwide to fix faulty brake control software that could increase the risk of a crash.</seg>
<seg id="16">In September, it recalled 908,900 vehicles around the world for defective accelerator sensors that could cause engines to stall.</seg>
<seg id="17">Ghosn said Nissan was very determined to address quality issues aggressively.</seg>
<seg id="18">We are really tightening.</seg>
<seg id="19">"We take this very seriously," he said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Weaker-than-expected sales in Russia, Australia, Indonesia, Thailand and Brazil took a toll on sales, but Ghosn said Nissan has done relatively well in China, despite slowing growth in that market, regaining market share lost due to disruptions from a territorial dispute between Tokyo and Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ghosn said Nissan has been stretched, with nine plants in construction or expansion at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="22">He noted that with $831 billion ($8.5 billion) in cash on hand, the company was engaging in its highest investment level ever.</seg>
<seg id="23">A little bit of the bad news, we could overcome.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Too much of the bad news, impossible," he said.</seg>
<seg id="25">Still, Ghosn was confident about the automaker's capacity to respond to its recent hardships in the longer term.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company, allied with Renault of France, will begin making cars in Brazil in 2014, helping to reduce costs from tariffs imposed on its vehicles imported from Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="27">Nissan's half-year profit rose 6.8 percent to 189.8 billion yen ($1.9 billion) from 177.7 billion yen a year earlier.</seg>
<seg id="28">In unit terms, Nissan's global sales fell 1.5 percent due to declines in Europe and emerging markets.</seg>
<seg id="29">But sales in the U.S. jumped 14.5 percent and in Japan rose 3.6 percent.</seg>
<seg id="30">Ghosn said the new management lineup would seek stronger discipline in reining in costs.</seg>

<seg id="1">A first for British television as cameras are allowed into Court of Appeal</seg>
<seg id="2">It was more than a little like travelling back in time.</seg>
<seg id="3">Cameras have been banned in the courts (apart from the Supreme Court, a recent invention and one in which the judges don't even wear wigs and robes) since the Criminal Justice Act of 1925.</seg>
<seg id="4">But anybody who had wandered into a public gallery of the Royal Courts of Justice in the mid-1920s would have found the first-ever televised Court of Appeal proceedings instantly recognisable.</seg>
<seg id="5">Partly of course it was the case itself.</seg>
<seg id="6">Counterfeiting coins is as old as money itself, and the application to appeal by Kevin Fisher against a seven-year sentence for his role in a plot to forge one-pound coins on what the trial judge had described as "very substantial scale" would have been entirely familiar.</seg>
<seg id="7">Was it not such a counterfeiter whom Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson ran to ground in the Conan Doyle story "The Adventure of the Three Garridebs"?</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was also the almost excruciating politeness, especially on the part of Fisher's counsel, Alexander Cameron, who happens to be the Prime Minister's elder brother.</seg>
<seg id="9">The broadcasters, while justly emphasising what a historic moment this was after years of tortuous negotiations to get cameras into the courts, kept half-apologising that the case was one that would not normally be of much interest.</seg>
<seg id="10">They needn't have done.</seg>
<seg id="11">How else would we have seen in action the QC whom at Eton his younger brother, had, by his own account, looked up to, and perhaps been somewhat in awe of?</seg>
<seg id="12">As David Cameron, who watched his brother's appearance on his iPhone on a train to Wolverhampton, noted, the "noise and atmosphere" of the Court of Appeal was "rather different" from that of Prime Minister's Questions.</seg>
<seg id="13">And how.</seg>
<seg id="14">At one point Lord Justice Pitchford, presiding, interrupted the barrister to dispute his contention that since one of Fisher's co-defendants had received a much lighter sentence, his own client's should be shortened.</seg>
<seg id="15">His collaborator might have been "fortunate, but the fact that he was generously treated by the judge doesn't necessarily mean the sentence imposed on the applicant is unfairly disparate."</seg>
<seg id="16">Cameron, his voice a little plummier, his face and figure a little fuller, than his younger brother's, replied swiftly: "My Lord, I completely agree with that....," before going on with consummate courtesy to add that the difference between two and seven years was nevertheless "too great a difference for the Court, in my respectful submission, to accept."</seg>
<seg id="17">For a second you wildly imagined his brother saying at the despatch box: "I completely agree with the Leader of the Opposition on that point, but perhaps if he considers it in a slightly different way...." or some such.</seg>
<seg id="18">And unimagined it pretty quick.</seg>
<seg id="19">So this was hardly big box office.</seg>
<seg id="20">Yet for all the lack of excitement generated - say - by the live coverage of the OJ Simpson trial, it was a breakthrough moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">There has long been a disjunction over the fact that those few who have the time can watch court proceedings from the public gallery but not on TV.</seg>
<seg id="22">James Harding, director of news and current affairs for the BBC, which with ITN, Sky News and the Press Association had successfully persuaded in 2011 the then Justice Secretary Ken Clarke to lift the filming ban, was surely right to describe it as a "landmark moment for justice and journalism" which would help viewers to a better understanding of the judicial system in England and Wales.</seg>
<seg id="23">The other constant since the 1920s is the pleasantly old-fashioned language - such as the repeated use of the near archaic "one" by the QC.</seg>
<seg id="24">Cameron, whose colleagues from his chambers, Three Raymond Buildings, were representing some of the defendants, including Charlie Brooks, in a rather higher profile hearing across at the Old Bailey, was citing an earlier case as a precedent for shortening his client's sentence: "So my Lords, there one has someone who is doing all the things one would be doing if one was a prime instigator of a whole operation, part of which includes custody and distribution [of forged coins] which was all the applicant was concerned with...."</seg>
<seg id="25">But the presence of Cameron, who said he had been "surprised" to be pleading his case on live TV and had only learnt that he would be doing so the previous day, was not the only point of interest.</seg>
<seg id="26">We learnt a bit about the forgers" world: the 20 cardboard boxes each containing 1,000 counterterfeit coins, and the brown blank metal discs (nearly 1.5 million of them) that had been used as evidence against Fisher; the "purchase of special equipment, ink and foil, memory sticks"; the use of "pseudonyms and front companies" in one earlier case.</seg>
<seg id="27">And in another case, the difficulties one set of forgers had found in getting the right quality paper to fake $6m worth of banknotes.</seg>
<seg id="28">And in this case, the car swapping - or as Lord Justice Pitchford put it, the "anti-surveillance attempts" Fisher's forgery ring had mounted, including on his fateful journey from his home in Hertfordshire to where he was arrested at Park View Farm in Essex.</seg>
<seg id="29">It must have been an odd day for Fisher, who was not in court but may still have been able to see the proceedings - and their outcome - in real time.</seg>
<seg id="30">But also a disappointing one.</seg>
<seg id="31">After briefly withdrawing to consider what had really been little more than an oral supplement to Cameron's written submission, Lord Justice Pitchford announced that he was rejecting his grounds for appeal.</seg>
<seg id="32">So a bad day for Kevin Fisher.</seg>
<seg id="33">But a great day, surely, for open justice.</seg>

<seg id="1">FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on planes (but not make cell phone calls)</seg>
<seg id="2">Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices gate-to-gate to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music - but not talk on their cellphones - under much-anticipated new guidelines issued Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.</seg>
<seg id="3">But passengers shouldn't expect changes to happen immediately.</seg>
<seg id="4">How fast the change is implemented will vary by the airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a news conference.</seg>
<seg id="5">Airlines will have to show the FAA how their airplanes meet the new guidelines and that they've updating their flight crew training manuals and rules for stowing devices to reflect the new guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="6">The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Delta and JetBlue were among the airliners who have already submitted plans.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Depending on the condition of the plan, we could approve expanded use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="9">Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices once a plane's door closes.</seg>
<seg id="10">They're not supposed to restart them until the planes reach 10,000 feet and the captain gives the go-ahead.</seg>
<seg id="11">Passengers are supposed to turn their devices off again as the plane descends to land and not restart them until the plane is on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="12">Under the new guidelines, airlines whose planes are properly protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use the devices during takeoffs, landings and taxiing, the FAA said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Most new airliners and other planes that have been modified so that passengers can use Wifi at higher altitudes are expected to meet the criteria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed the changes.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Once the new policy is safely implemented - and we're going to work closely with the carrier to do that - it will be a win-win," Glading said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="16">We're frankly tired of feeling like 'hall monitors' when it comes to this issue.</seg>
<seg id="17">But connecting to the Internet to surf, exchange emails, text or download data will still be prohibited below 10,000 feet, the agency said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Passengers will be told to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to airplane mode.</seg>
<seg id="19">So, still no Words With Friends, the online Scrabble-type game that actor Alec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone in 2011 when he was famously booted off an American Airlines jet for refusing to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">And heavier devices such as laptops will continue to have to be stowed because of concern they might injure someone if they go flying around the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="21">In-flight cellphone calls also will continue to be prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="22">Regulatory authority over phone calls belongs to the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.</seg>
<seg id="23">FAA may lift ban on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing</seg>
<seg id="24">Last month, National Transportation Safety Board Mark Rosenker, a CBS News national transportation safety expert, said that cell phones are still considered a risk.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Cell phones, that really is an issue, not just because potentially it could create interference with navigational devices, but we do know, according to the FCC, that it could interfere with cell phone towers when they're in the air," Rosenker said.</seg>
<seg id="26">An industry advisory committee created by the FAA to examine the issue recommended last month that the government permit greater use of personal electronic devices.</seg>
<seg id="27">Pressure has been building on the FAA in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.</seg>
<seg id="28">Critics such as Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., contend there is no valid safety reason for the prohibitions.</seg>
<seg id="29">The restrictions have also become increasingly difficult to enforce as use of the devices has become ubiquitous.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some studies indicate as many as a third of passengers forget or ignore directions to turn off their devices.</seg>
<seg id="31">The FAA began restricting passengers' use of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of interference with navigation and communications equipment when passengers began carrying FM radios, the high-tech gadgets of their day.</seg>
<seg id="32">New airliners are far more reliant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference.</seg>
<seg id="33">Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi use at cruising altitudes to passengers for several years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Planes modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.</seg>
<seg id="35">The vast majority of airliners should qualify for greater electronic device use under the new guidelines, Huerta said.</seg>
<seg id="36">Today's electronic devices generally emit much lower power radio transmissions than previous generations of devices.</seg>
<seg id="37">E-readers, for example, emit only minimal transmissions when turning a page.</seg>
<seg id="38">But transmissions are stronger when devices are downloading or sending data.</seg>
<seg id="39">Among those pressing for a relaxation of restrictions on passengers' use of the devices has been Amazon.com.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 2011, company officials loaded an airliner full of their Kindle e-readers and flew it around to test for problems but found none.</seg>
<seg id="41">FAA advisory committee members expressed mixed feelings about whether use of the devices presents any risk.</seg>
<seg id="42">Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believes interference from the devices is genuine even if the risk is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="43">Other committee members said there are only anecdotal reports from pilots to support that the devices can interfere with aircraft systems, and most of those reports are very old.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, the committee recommended the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to shut off devices during instrument landings in low visibility.</seg>
<seg id="45">A travel industry group welcomed the changes, calling them common-sense accommodations for a traveling public now bristling with technology.</seg>
<seg id="46">"We're pleased the FAA recognizes that an enjoyable passenger experience is not incompatible with safety and security," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.</seg>

<seg id="8">School children have fled a burning bus which caught fire on the M2 motorway in northwest Sydney.</seg>
<seg id="9">Fire & Rescue NSW said on its Twitter page about 40 people had got off the school bus and heavy traffic was banking up at Carlingford about 3.30pm (AEDT) on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="10">Inspector Phil Brooks from the NSW Police Traffic and Highway Patrol Command said a group of school children were walking away from the burning bus.</seg>
<seg id="11">Looks like we've got a load of school children off the bus.</seg>
<seg id="12">"They're walking back up the M2 now to get out of the way," he told Macquarie Radio.</seg>
<seg id="13">But this bus is well and truly on fire as we speak.</seg>
<seg id="14">A Fire & Rescue spokeswoman told AAP the engine compartment of the bus had caught fire and the first emergency call came in at 3.13pm.</seg>
<seg id="15">She said school children and teachers had safely disembarked from the bus, but it was not yet known what school they attended or whether they were primary or high school-aged students.</seg>
<seg id="16">Three fire crews are battling the blaze, she said.</seg>
